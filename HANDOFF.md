# HANDOFF — Beagle Classroom

## QUIZ C5B MODERATION EVIDENCE — 2026-07-18

- Added Student reporting for a complete Quiz and for an individual question. A question report captures the immutable Attempt snapshot that Student actually saw, so a later Teacher edit cannot rewrite case evidence.
- Quiz evidence stores Teacher-authored title/description, question and option text, plus private attachment metadata. It deliberately excludes correct-option secrets, Teacher explanations, Student answers, Attempt grading/scores, personal exceptions, submitted files, R2 keys, and public/signed URLs.
- Moderation restrictions now hide a Quiz from Student discovery and fail closed on overview, start, save, submit, and direct Attempt reads. Existing Attempts, answers, grading, Score Item, and Score Entries remain untouched; Admin stays a safety observer and receives no academic mutation.
- Extended the Admin case detail with theme-safe Quiz/question evidence rendering and the existing authenticated evidence-file route. Student restricted routes return a normal 404 instead of an error boundary.
- Acceptance passed: focused isolated-Neon integration `2/2`, full unit `616/616`, targeted ESLint, TypeScript, `git diff --check`, and Next.js Production build. Production Quiz migration, rollout flags, database data, and R2 objects were not changed. C5a authenticated private-R2 smoke and the broader one-course Quiz rollout gate remain open.

## QUIZ C5A PRIVATE ATTACHMENTS — 2026-07-18

- Enabled private multi-file attachments for the Quiz brief, individual questions, and individual answer options. Teacher uploads keep stable Quiz/Question/Option owner ids, validate uploader plus exact owner scope transactionally, and remain accessible only through the authenticated `/api/storage/files/[fileId]` route.
- Added Teacher Builder upload/replace support, Student-safe Quiz overview and immutable Attempt snapshot metadata, Teacher full-page preview, responsive image grids, keyboard/arrow galleries, and authenticated document links. Student payloads still exclude answer keys and explanations; snapshots contain no R2 key or public file URL.
- Moderation remains fail closed: restricted file metadata is filtered before a new Attempt snapshot is created and the download route rejects restricted files for every non-Admin role. Legacy Attempt snapshots without attachment arrays remain readable.
- Fixed multi-select upload capacity so an existing batch cannot race past the 10-file limit. Duplicate questions receive fresh owner ids and intentionally do not copy private attachments across ownership boundaries.
- Acceptance passed: targeted ESLint, TypeScript, full unit `616/616`, focused attachment/permission/Attempt tests `77/77`, `git diff --check`, HTTP `200` on the isolated login surface, and the Next.js Production build. Authenticated isolated-QA upload/R2 smoke and all Production migration/flag changes remain separate rollout gates; Production data and flags were not mutated.

## DASHBOARD VARIANT B PRODUCT CUTOVER — 2026-07-18

- Replaced the Student and Teacher Dashboard body with the approved Variant B operating layout while preserving the existing course-card visual language and real database projections.
- Added a theme-safe focus dock, an expanding left navigation rail, a two-column course workspace, and a right-side actionable brief. Repeated metrics were removed: each surface now owns a distinct decision or shortcut instead of restating the same count.
- Restored and upgraded the TopNav account/notification area with the existing Profile, Theme, Notification, and feature-gated Moderation destinations intact. Admin Dashboard behavior remains unchanged.
- Removed the absorbed development-only Dashboard prototype route and prototype-only mascot asset. No schema, database row, R2 object, Production flag, or role permission changed.
- Acceptance passed: targeted ESLint, `git diff --check`, TypeScript through the Next.js Production build, and all 22 production routes. Authenticated visual acceptance still requires a signed-in QA session because the current isolated-QA seed credentials are not reusable.

## QUIZ C4 TEACHER RESULTS AND PUBLICATION — 2026-07-18

- Added the real feature-gated Teacher Quiz Results workspace for Open and Closed Quiz states. It shows Student status counts, best-Attempt history, average/high/low/pass metrics, duration, and per-question response/correctness analysis while keeping Admin outside academic mutations.
- Completed the Teacher lifecycle: close finalizes every in-progress Attempt, reopen is allowed only before publication with a future close time plus required reason, and per-Student deadline/attempt exceptions are private, audited, and notify only the affected Student. A later global reopen deadline cannot be shortened by an older exception.
- Scored Quiz publication is one-way and remains owned by the Quiz workflow. It requires Closed status, explicitly lists missing active Students, requires Teacher confirmation, and writes an explicit zero Score Entry for every confirmed missing Student before publishing the linked `QUIZ_LINKED` Score Item. Published result metrics use the score ledger as their source of truth; item analysis continues to use submitted Attempts only.
- Added Quiz reopen/exception notification kinds, safe destination routing, audit labels/tiers, and generic Score Item guards so Quiz-linked rows cannot be edited or published through the normal gradebook workflow.
- Applied the additive lifecycle-notification enum migration to isolated Neon QA only. Production migration and Quiz rollout flags remain unchanged and require separate explicit approval.
- Acceptance passed: full unit `612/612`, authenticated Teacher Results lifecycle Playwright `1/1`, Desktop/iPhone responsive and overflow checks, targeted ESLint/TypeScript, and the Next.js Production build including `/teacher/courses/[id]/quizzes/[quizId]/results`.

## QUIZ C3 STUDENT ATTEMPT — 2026-07-18

- Added the real feature-gated Student Quiz center, Lesson-linked Quiz cards, Quiz detail/start flow, and one-question-per-page Attempt workspace. The responsive UI includes question checkpoints, answered progress, server-adjusted timer, autosave feedback, final unanswered-question confirmation, a sticky mobile action bar, and a clear submitted/result state.
- Student Attempt persistence now supports start/resume, device lease takeover, hashed lease cookies, optimistic write revisions, idempotent answer/submit mutations, immutable Attempt snapshots, server-authoritative deadline or closed-Quiz auto-submit, exact all-or-nothing objective auto-grading, Attempt limits, and per-Student deadline/attempt exceptions already present in the schema.
- Teachers can open a valid Draft Quiz from its Builder and both roles now have a dedicated feature-gated Quiz tab and course-level list. Open validation rejects archived parents, empty quizzes, expired close times, invalid scored Score Item coupling, and any Quiz that already has an Attempt.
- Scored Quiz submission writes the Student's best submitted Attempt into the linked draft Score Entry while preserving one-way score publication. Practice scores are visible immediately; Scored Quiz scores remain hidden until the linked Score Item is published. Teacher results, close/reopen, exception management UI, and publication workflow remain the next slice.
- Closed a security boundary found during final review: the Student React payload is now a sanitized snapshot with no `isCorrect` field or Teacher explanation. The complete answer key remains Server/DB-only. Raw lease tokens are never persisted, and read-only feature-flag mode cannot finalize or mutate an Attempt.
- Isolated Neon QA acceptance passes for Student sign-in, Quiz discovery, start, autosave persistence, final submit, visible Practice score, cleanup, and Desktop 1440×900 plus iPhone 390×844 visual/overflow checks. Full unit passes `602/602`, Quiz E2E passes `1/1`, targeted ESLint, TypeScript, and the Production build pass.
- Production remains unchanged: Quiz migration/flags and pilot rollout still require a separate explicit approval. C3 code is accepted on isolated QA only.

## QUIZ C2 ISOLATED QA ACCEPTANCE — 2026-07-18

- Applied `20260717010000_add_quiz_foundation` to the identity-checked Neon QA branch only. Prisma reports all five QA migrations up to date; Production schema and Vercel flags remain unchanged.
- The isolated QA server now enables Quiz reads and mutations with the QA-only wildcard allowlist after `prepareIsolatedDatabaseEnv` proves `QA_DATABASE_URL` is distinct from the primary database. Explicit `QUIZ_ENABLED=0` and `QUIZ_MUTATIONS_ENABLED=0` overrides still fail closed.
- Added authenticated Playwright acceptance for the real Teacher Builder. It creates a Practice draft through the UI, verifies debounced autosave, switches to Scored mode, proves atomic `QUIZ_LINKED` Score Item creation and score updates, duplicates a question, opens both previews without creating an Attempt, and checks 390 px document overflow.
- Visual review passed for desktop 1440×900 and mobile 390×844. Focused Quiz/QA unit tests pass `12/12`, the Playwright flow passes `1/1`, targeted ESLint and TypeScript pass, and the fixture removes its temporary Quiz, Score Item, Lesson, Course, and users from QA.
- C2 is accepted on isolated QA. Production migration/flags remain a later explicit rollout decision. The next implementation slice is C3 Student Attempt, autosave, timer, resume, and objective auto-grading.

## TEACHER QUIZ BUILDER C2 — 2026-07-17

- Added the real feature-gated Teacher Quiz draft workflow under a Lesson. Teachers can create a free-form Quiz, edit metadata and settings, add/delete/duplicate/reorder questions, manage objective options and correct answers, see the calculated total score, and open an in-context or full-page Student preview.
- Draft persistence replaces the complete validated Quiz atomically. Scored Quiz creation creates exactly one `QUIZ_LINKED` Score Item in the same transaction; switching modes creates/deletes the still-unpublished empty linked item safely. Draft content locks after the first Attempt, and Preview never creates an Attempt, answer, Score Entry, notification, or audit row.
- Existing drafts use a 1.2-second debounced auto-save with explicit saving/saved/error feedback. The initial new Quiz still requires one deliberate save to create its record. Pre-open draft CUD stays Verbose-tier and intentionally emits no Audit event.
- All Teacher routes and Lesson entry points fail closed through `QUIZ_ENABLED`, `QUIZ_MUTATIONS_ENABLED`, and exact `QUIZ_PILOT_COURSE_IDS` checks before any Quiz database read. With the current disabled flags, existing Production UI and unmigrated databases do not query Quiz tables.
- Private Quiz attachment ids are still rejected by the service. The UI states that multi-file support is a later boundary; Student Attempt, open/close, grading/results, notifications, Moderation evidence, and Admin observer are not implemented in C2.
- Focused Quiz unit tests pass `22/22`, full unit passes `580/580`, targeted ESLint and TypeScript pass, and the Next.js Production build includes all three gated Teacher routes. The additive Quiz migration remains unapplied to Neon QA and Production, so real database/visual acceptance is still pending and no rollout flag should be enabled yet.

## QUIZ FOUNDATION C1 — 2026-07-17

- Added the additive Quiz persistence foundation: Quiz, questions, options, Attempts, answers, idempotent Attempt mutations, per-Student exceptions, immutable Attempt snapshots, lease/revision fields, and `QUIZ_LINKED` Score Item provenance.
- Prepared migration `20260717010000_add_quiz_foundation` offline from the committed schema. It has **not** been applied to Neon QA or Production; no database data, R2 object, or Vercel flag was mutated in this slice.
- Added fail-closed `QUIZ_ENABLED`, `QUIZ_MUTATIONS_ENABLED`, and exact-course `QUIZ_PILOT_COURSE_IDS` policy. Missing or empty pilot ids enable no course; `*` is reserved for isolated QA.
- Added pure Zod validation and lifecycle/Attempt policy for objective question limits, scored defaults, immutable-content guards, server-authoritative deadlines, one-writer lease/revision checks, all-or-nothing objective grading, and best-Attempt selection.
- Extended private-file owner compatibility for Quiz/Question/Option. Student reads fail closed for drafts, future-open, cancelled, or archived Quiz content; Presign mutations remain rejected by the existing upload guard until the Teacher Builder service slice is implemented.
- Gradebook recognizes `QUIZ_LINKED` items but hides publish/delete actions there. Quiz-linked scores must be managed by the future Quiz workflow, preserving ADR-0036 coupling.
- Verification passed: Prisma validate/generate, targeted ESLint, TypeScript, focused Quiz/storage unit `59/59`, full unit `574/574`, and Next.js Production build. Repository-wide `eslint .` remains blocked by the documented generated `.next-qa` and bundled `.claude` files; no changed Quiz file has a lint finding.
- Next implementation slice: Teacher draft Builder and preview only. Student Attempt mutations and any database migration remain separately gated.

## QUIZ DOMAIN ADRS — 2026-07-17

- Release C architecture design is now locked in ADR-0035 through ADR-0038: immutable Attempt snapshots, atomic Scored Quiz/Score Item coupling, one-writer device leases with Server-authoritative expiry, and archive/moderation/private-file evidence rules.
- Practice Quiz never creates a Score Item. Scored Quiz introduces immutable `QUIZ_LINKED` provenance, uses the existing sum-based score ledger, and must close before one-way publication. Best submitted Attempt supplies the draft Score Entry while preserving auto-grade evidence.
- The first Student Attempt freezes Teacher-authored questions, answers, points, and assigned order. Post-start correction is an irreversible audited question void plus recalculation; normal editing or hard deletion is blocked.
- Attempt writes require the current lease, revision, and idempotency key. Device takeover invalidates the old writer, Server time determines expiry, and correctness does not depend only on cron.
- Quiz/question reports snapshot Teacher-authored content but exclude Student answers, scores, exceptions, and private Attempt files. Admin remains read-only and cannot perform academic actions.
- This ADR slice itself changed no schema or data. The subsequent C1 foundation described above now implements the additive schema and pure policy layer, while all database rollout remains unapproved.

## QUIZ MVP GRILL AND PROTOTYPE — 2026-07-17

- Quiz MVP decision Grill is complete. The approved product contract lives in `docs/QUIZ-MVP-DECISIONS.md` and covers lifecycle, scoring, Attempts, files, privacy, notifications, analytics, limits, feature flags, and rollout guardrails.
- Added a non-persistent, development-only prototype at `/teacher/courses/[id]/quiz-prototype`. Production returns `notFound()` and the prototype does not read or write Quiz data.
- The prototype provides three switchable surfaces: Teacher Builder, Student Attempt, and Teacher Results. It also includes Light, Dark, and Cream theme controls, responsive question navigation, attachment affordances, timer/auto-save language, result metrics, Student status, and item analysis.
- Visual acceptance passed at 1440x900 and 390x844 for all three surfaces. Light, Dark, and Cream were inspected; document-level horizontal overflow is zero. Teacher question cards intentionally scroll inside their own mobile strip, and the results table intentionally scrolls inside its own container.
- Targeted ESLint and full TypeScript typecheck pass. No Prisma schema, Neon data, R2 object, feature flag, Production route, or existing Feed/Lesson/Score behavior was changed.
- Prototype review, the four prerequisite ADRs, and the additive C1 schema/policy foundation are complete. The next step is the Teacher draft Builder and preview; Production migration remains separately unapproved.

## NOTIFICATION SHORTCUT AND ROUTER ACCEPTANCE — 2026-07-17

- Every bell row now exposes a visible destination shortcut instead of relying on an invisible whole-row click. Labels match the destination: scores, work, document, announcement, course, or members.
- Audited all 9 `NotificationKind` values across Student and Teacher routing, including Lesson-aware deep links and safe legacy fallbacks. Existing Admin behavior remains the Dashboard fallback because Admin receives no teaching notifications.
- Hardened navigation against form tampering. The browser submits only the Notification id; the server reloads a non-suppressed row owned by the signed-in recipient and computes the route from its immutable snapshot. Client-submitted redirect URLs were removed.
- Verification passed: route/label unit `35/35`, full unit `558/558`, focused Student Material and Teacher class-join Playwright `3/3`, TypeScript, targeted ESLint, and Production build. The isolated Neon QA branch was used; Production data and flags were not mutated.

## QR AND INVITE ACCEPTANCE — 2026-07-17

- Restored the existing Teacher-only Class Code surface to Course Settings as a complete invite handoff card. It now shows a scannable QR, class code, absolute invite URL, course/class context, expiry, and a clear ready/disabled/expired state with copy actions. Student surfaces do not render the management card or regeneration controls.
- Added a pure `getClassCodeInviteStatus` domain helper with an injectable clock. Disabled state takes precedence, the exact expiry boundary fails closed, and active codes without an expiry remain ready.
- Added isolated-Neon Playwright acceptance across a Dark Teacher desktop and Cream Student iPhone 390x844 flow. It verifies the QR payload/invite URL, prefilled code, first join, removal plus restoration of the same Enrollment on rejoin, no mobile horizontal overflow, and hidden Teacher-only controls.
- The same browser acceptance proves expired, disabled, and regenerated stale codes fail closed before the fresh regenerated code succeeds. Existing class-code mutation and enrollment-domain coverage remains intact.
- Verification passed: full unit `548/548` (including focused class-code `19/19`), focused class-code/enrollment integration `11/11`, QR/invite Playwright `2/2`, TypeScript, targeted ESLint, formatting, and the Next.js Production build. Physical phone-camera scanning remains a manual OS/device release check; there is intentionally no in-app camera scanner. Production database, Lesson flags, private R2 objects, and rollout state were not mutated by this slice.

## MODERATION REPORT ACCEPTANCE FOLLOW-UP — 2026-07-16

- Fixed the missing Moderation report flag on isolated QA. `dev:qa` previously enabled only Lesson Workspace flags, so port 3100 hid every `ReportContentButton` even though the Moderation schema and workflow were present. The isolated server now defaults `MODERATION_CENTER_ENABLED=1` while preserving an explicit `0` override for fail-closed acceptance checks.
- Student Lesson detail exposes the existing report dialog beside every Material and Assignment checkpoint. Navigation and report controls are separate interactive elements, avoiding nested links/buttons and preserving direct checkpoint access.
- Added an authenticated Playwright acceptance flow on the isolated Neon QA branch: Student in Cream theme at 390×844 reports an Assignment checkpoint, the report is aggregated into a Moderation Case, then Admin in Dark theme opens the queue item and reads the immutable evidence snapshot. The fixture and case are removed after the run.
- Fixed a real mobile regression found by that flow: the Lesson Material/Assignment grid used an automatic min-content track and expanded a 342 px card to 489 px. The grid and content sections now use shrinkable `minmax(0,1fr)` / `min-w-0` constraints, and the E2E test asserts document width against the mobile viewport.
- Isolated QA now explicitly uses `LESSON_WORKSPACE_PILOT_COURSE_IDS=*`. This prevents Next.js from reloading Production pilot ids from `.env.local` and rejecting newly generated QA courses, while normal development and Production values remain unchanged.
- Verification passed: Moderation E2E 1/1, focused feature/env unit 11/11, full unit assertions before the added wildcard case 543/543, targeted ESLint, TypeScript, and Production build. Production private-R2 upload/preview and authenticated Production smoke remain separate rollout acceptance; do not describe those as completed by this local QA run.

## LESSON WORKSPACE STUDENT PROTOTYPE C PARITY — 2026-07-16

- The real Student Lesson list now uses the approved Prototype C learning-path presentation instead of a generic vertical card list. It includes a continuous Lesson path, per-Lesson state marker, real Material/Assignment checkpoints, current-Student progress, next task, overdue state, and restrained entrance/progress motion with reduced-motion support.
- The Student contract is unchanged: every active Lesson remains directly openable, progress is submitted Assignments divided by total Assignments, opening a Material does not count as completion, and the projection still selects only the caller's Enrollment submissions. Student Lesson detail no longer labels free-form Lessons with a fixed ordinal title.
- Isolated Neon QA accepted Light and Dark desktop plus Cream and Dark iPhone 390 px list/detail renders with zero horizontal overflow. Temporary users, course, Lessons, Materials, Assignments, and Submission were removed after the run.
- Verification passed: targeted ESLint, TypeScript, full unit `543/543`, and Production build. Feed remains the default course landing; Lesson flags and Production rollout state are unchanged.

## LESSON WORKSPACE B6 ACCEPTANCE FOLLOW-UP — 2026-07-16

- Teacher Lesson list is now aligned with the approved Prototype B interaction model: course header, free-form Lesson creation modal, left Lesson structure, right selected-Lesson summary, reorder controls, archived section, and direct entry to the existing real Lesson detail workspace. Announcement remains course-wide in Feed and is not presented as Lesson-owned data.
- The previous real page was not a faithful Prototype B projection: it used an inline create form and a vertical card list. That UI was replaced; the Prototype routes remain available only as historical design references.
- `dev:qa` now enables Lesson read/mutation flags only after `prepareIsolatedDatabaseEnv()` has replaced `DATABASE_URL` with the separately identity-checked `QA_DATABASE_URL`. Normal local `dev`, Production, default-route cutover, schema migration, and Production data remain untouched and fail closed.
- Isolated Neon QA accepted real create flow on desktop and iPhone 390 px with no horizontal overflow. The temporary Teacher/course/Lesson fixture was deleted after the run. TypeScript, targeted ESLint, full unit `542/542`, and the Production build passed.
- To test safely, use `pnpm dev:qa`, open `http://localhost:3100`, sign in with a QA Teacher, enter a course, open `บทเรียน`, and press `สร้างบทเรียน`. Do not add Lesson flags to the normal Production-backed `.env.local` development flow.
- Feed parity follow-up: Assignment and Material projections now carry `lessonId` plus the free-form Lesson title. Teacher and Student cards render a compact, clickable Lesson flag; legacy unlinked content is labelled `ยังไม่จัดบทเรียน` for Teachers instead of silently losing context. Regression test covers the Prisma projection. Light/Dark/Cream and Desktop/iPhone 390 px visual QA passed without horizontal overflow; temporary QA data was removed.

## LESSON WORKSPACE B6 — 2026-07-15

- Admin Lesson observer is implemented on `phase-11`. The Admin course shell now exposes a feature-flagged `บทเรียน` tab with aggregate list and detail routes for active or archived courses.
- Admin can read Lesson titles/descriptions, Assignment/Material content, active-student totals, submitted/missing/late/pending-grading counts, and aggregate completion. The projection does not select Student identity, scores, attendance, Submission versions, private comments, or submitted files. No teaching mutation actions are rendered, and non-Admin query callers are rejected before a database read.
- Added optional `LESSON_WORKSPACE_PILOT_COURSE_IDS`. When absent, the existing read flag keeps all-course behavior; when present, only exact comma-separated CourseOffering ids are enabled; an explicitly empty value enables no courses. The same course gate controls tabs, routes, mutations, Feed composer requirements, and Lesson-aware notification links.
- Verification passed: TypeScript, targeted ESLint, production build, full unit `540/540`, and local QA on desktop plus iPhone 390 px. Admin list/detail had no horizontal overflow, no private identity, and no mutation controls. The temporary QA Admin was deleted after the run.
- The three local 400 responses observed during visual QA were existing missing Teacher avatar objects caused by the documented local-storage/R2 pointer mismatch, not Lesson routes. No database repair was attempted.
- Production migration/backfill/flags/pilot/default-route/deployment remain untouched. B6 code is complete, but Production rollout acceptance is still open: choose one CourseOffering id, configure fail-closed flags, redeploy, run production permission/theme/mobile/performance smoke, rehearse flag-off rollback, then widen only after approval. Feed remains the default landing.

## LESSON WORKSPACE B5 — 2026-07-15

- Feed/notification parity is complete on `phase-11`. Feed remains the chronological canonical projection and the default Student/Teacher course landing; no route cutover was made.
- New Assignment, Material, submission grade/return, and relevant comment notification snapshots now carry an optional `lessonId`. When the fail-closed Lesson read flag is enabled, the bell opens the exact Assignment or Material checkpoint inside its Lesson.
- Legacy notifications without `lessonId`, all course-wide Announcements, and every notification while the flag is disabled keep the existing direct detail URL. Existing Feed links and bookmarks are unchanged.
- Student and Teacher Lesson detail pages expose stable `assignment-{id}` and `material-{id}` anchors with visible keyboard/target focus. Creating an empty Lesson still emits no notification because Lesson mutations have no notification producer.
- Verification passed: TypeScript, targeted ESLint, production build, full unit `528/528`, and targeted isolated-Neon integration `19/19`. Full-repository lint remains blocked by pre-existing generated `.next-qa` and bundled `.claude` skill files, not B5 files.
- Production schema, data, flags, default routes, deployment, and `main` remain untouched. B6 Admin observer code is now complete; Production pilot rollout still requires separate approval. Disabling the Lesson flag restores legacy navigation without data rollback.

## LESSON WORKSPACE B4 — 2026-07-15

- Student Learning Path is complete on `phase-11`: the Student course tabs now expose a dedicated Lesson list and Lesson detail while Feed remains the default course experience.
- All active Lessons are visible without sequential locks. Archived Lessons stay collapsed under `บทเรียนที่จบแล้ว`.
- Progress is the current Student's submitted Assignments divided by total Assignments. Opening a Material does not count as completion; the UI shows the current Student's next task, due date, overdue state, and per-Assignment status.
- The query's L1 privacy boundary filters nested Submission rows by the caller's active Enrollment id and does not select peer progress, score, attendance, or submission data.
- Verification passed: TypeScript, targeted ESLint, production build, unit `522/522`, and Playwright on Desktop plus iPhone 390 px. Dark, Light, and Cream visual QA passed without horizontal overflow. The temporary Neon QA fixture was removed after acceptance.
- Production Lesson migration, backfill, flags, route cutover, and deploy remain unapproved and untouched. Next planned slice is B5 Feed/notification deep-link parity; Feed-first routing must remain unchanged until that slice passes.

## LESSON WORKSPACE B3 — 2026-07-15

- Teacher Lesson workflow is complete on `phase-11`: list/detail routes, create, rename, reorder, guarded archive, empty deletion, and audited Assignment/Material moves are implemented.
- Feed composer requires an active Lesson for Assignment/Material, preselects the current Lesson from its detail page, and provides a direct create-Lesson shortcut when a course has no Lessons. Announcement remains course-wide.
- Lesson detail shows submitted, missing, late, and pending-grading counts and links each Assignment to the existing review workspace. Missing is calculated from active enrollments only.
- Desktop and iPhone-size QA passed on isolated Neon QA. TypeScript and production build passed; targeted Lesson tests passed 16/16.
- Commits: `b650f52` plus the B3 acceptance follow-up. Production Lesson migration, backfill, feature flags, default-route change, and deploy remain unapproved and untouched.
- B4 Student Learning Path is now complete; see the newer handoff section above. Do not start Production rollout or switch Feed-first routing without a separate explicit approval.

## LESSON WORKSPACE B2 — 2026-07-15

- Added a fail-closed compatibility planner. Its default and package-script behavior is read-only dry-run; `--apply` requires the exact `LESSON_BACKFILL_CONFIRM` token and an identity-checked `QA_DATABASE_URL`.
- Existing unassigned Assignment/Material rows map to one deterministic fallback Lesson named `เนื้อหาเดิม` per CourseOffering. Announcement remains course-wide.
- Apply uses one Serializable transaction, preserves content ids, writes one `LESSON_CONTENT_MOVED` Audit row per link, and verifies Assignment, Material, Submission, Score Entry, Comment, File Attachment, and Notification counts before commit.
- Isolated Neon QA result: 1 affected course, 1 Lesson created, 1 Assignment linked, 0 Materials linked. Entity counts were unchanged; Lesson +1 and Audit +1 matched the plan.
- Repeated dry-run is a no-op and the verifier reports 0 unassigned Assignment/Material rows and 0 cross-course links.
- Production migration/backfill remains unapproved and has not run. The B3 status above supersedes this historical B2 handoff note.

## LESSON WORKSPACE B1 — 2026-07-15

- Implemented the additive Lesson domain under `CourseOffering`.
- `Assignment.lessonId` and `Material.lessonId` are nullable and use `ON DELETE SET NULL`; `Announcement` remains course-wide.
- Added fail-closed read/mutation/default-route flags. No Lesson UI, mutation route, backfill, Feed replacement, or default-route change is included in B1.
- Owning Teacher may mutate active Lesson structure, active Student enrollment may read, and Admin is a read-only observer including archived courses.
- Added Important audit contracts for archive, empty deletion, and content moves. Fire sites are reserved for B3 mutations.
- Applied migration `20260715030000_add_lesson_workspace_foundation` to isolated Neon QA only. Verification: Lesson 0, linked legacy content 0, cross-course links 0, schema current.
- Verification passed: unit 507/507, TypeScript, targeted B1 ESLint, and Prisma generation. Full-repo ESLint still scans generated `.next-qa` and bundled `.claude` skill files; use targeted lint until ignore coverage is corrected separately.
- Production Lesson migration and all Lesson flags remain unapproved/off. Do not migrate Production or start B2 backfill without a separate explicit decision.
- Moderation Center flag was enabled manually in Vercel on 2026-07-15; authenticated role/theme/mobile/private-R2 acceptance is still open and must not be described as fully accepted.

## 🚀 PRODUCTION OPS — 2026-06-13 ล่าสุด (อ่านก่อนสุด)

> รอบนี้ **ปล่อยขึ้น production จริงแล้ว** + ตั้ง R2 + แก้ perf — สรุปให้ Codex/session ใหม่ตามทัน

**Deploy ที่เกิดขึ้นจริง:**
- ✅ **PR #4 (phase-11 → main) merged แล้ว** → `main` = `1a0c934` · Vercel auto-deploy production สำเร็จ
- Production URL: `https://studen-project.vercel.app` รันโค้ดล่าสุด (profile/theme/admin observer/dashboard/FAB ครบ) — verify แล้ว route ใหม่ live, dark mode ทำงาน, avatar upload ทำงาน
- prod DB schema **already in sync** (push ไปก่อน merge — dev=prod ใช้ Neon ตัวเดียวกัน)

**R2 (Cloudflare) ตั้งเสร็จแล้ว — avatar/ไฟล์อัปบน prod ใช้ได้จริง:**
- bucket `beagle-classroom-prod` (Public Access **Disabled** — เสิร์ฟผ่าน signed URL เท่านั้น) · CORS ตั้ง origin production แล้ว
- Vercel env ตั้งครบ 4 ตัว (Production scope): `R2_ACCOUNT_ID` `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID` `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` `R2_BUCKET_NAME` · **secret อยู่ใน Vercel เท่านั้น ไม่เข้า repo**
- หมายเหตุโค้ด: ระบบใช้ R2 env 4 ตัวข้างบนเท่านั้น; `R2_PUBLIC_URL` ถูกลบออกจาก `docs/DEPLOY.md` ใน A0 Documentation Alignment แล้ว

**⚡ Perf fix (สำคัญ — เคยช้ามาก):**
- ต้นเหตุ: Vercel function รันที่ `iad1` (US East) แต่ Neon DB อยู่ `ap-southeast-1` (สิงคโปร์) → ทุก query วิ่งข้ามทวีป ~450ms × หลาย query/หน้า
- ✅ **แก้แล้ว: เปลี่ยน Vercel Function Region → Singapore (sin1)** (Settings → Functions) ให้ตรงกับ DB → เร็วขึ้นมาก
- ⏳ ยังเหลือ: Neon free-tier **cold start** (หลับหลัง ~5 นาที idle, ตื่น 1-3 วิ) — แก้ด้วย Neon paid หรือ keep-alive ping (ยังไม่ทำ) · และ `force-dynamic` ทุกหน้า = ไม่มี cache (refactor ทีหลัง)

**🟥 Gotchas ที่ session ใหม่/Codex ต้องรู้:**
1. **dev = prod ใช้ Neon DB ตัวเดียวกัน** — `prisma db push` / แก้ data ใด ๆ ที่ `.env.local` = กระทบ prod จริง ระวัง
2. **avatar/ไฟล์ที่อัปตอน dev mode → ไป `.local-storage` ในเครื่อง ไม่ขึ้น R2** → บน prod จะ "รูปแตก" (DB มี pointer แต่ R2 ไม่มีไฟล์). รอบนี้เจอ avatar ผี 2 อัน (อัปตอน dev) → **เคลียร์ profileImageId เป็น null แล้ว** ทั้ง 2 บัญชี (กลับไปใช้ default). ของจริงต้องอัปบน prod เท่านั้นถึงขึ้น R2
3. มีบัญชี test ค้างใน prod: student `990137` (ทดสอบ เอฟเอบี — Claude สมัครตอน verify FAB), student `36901234` (ธนภัทร), teacher `0940817471@hotmail.com` (wrw wqdq)
4. Vercel region ตอนนี้ = **sin1** · admin login: `Rayzxls` / (รหัสอยู่ใน session เก่า — ควร rotate)

### Production rollout update — 2026-07-15

- ✅ PR #8 merged เข้า `main` ที่ `7c18813`; GitHub CI และ Vercel Production ผ่าน
- ✅ Production ใช้ `prisma migrate deploy` ลง
  `20260715010000_add_account_lifecycle_foundation` และ
  `20260715020000_add_moderation_center_foundation` แล้ว ห้าม apply ซ้ำด้วย
  `db push`
- ✅ Post-migration aggregate verification: User `ACTIVE` 4, legacy mismatch 0,
  lifecycle event 0, moderation case/report/event 0 และ migration status up to date
- ⏸️ Behavior cutover ยังปิด: ต้องตั้ง Vercel Production env
  `ACCOUNT_LIFECYCLE_MUTATIONS_ENABLED=1` และ
  `MODERATION_CENTER_ENABLED=1` แล้ว redeploy ก่อน UI/mutation จะเปิด
- ไม่มี Vercel CLI/token ในเครื่องรอบนี้ จึงไม่ได้เปลี่ยน environment variables
  แทนผู้ใช้ และไม่ได้เปลี่ยนค่า default ใน code

## 🧭 PLANNING UPDATE — 2026-07-14 · Core → Lesson Workspace → Quiz → AI

> **ยังไม่อนุมัติให้เริ่ม Production development ของ Lesson Workspace** รอบนี้ทำ Prototype และวางแผนเท่านั้น ห้าม `db push`, backfill, เปลี่ยน default route หรือ wire mutation จนกว่าผู้ใช้จะสั่งเริ่ม Dev ชัดเจน

**แผนอ้างอิงหลัก:** `docs/NEXT-DEVELOPMENT-PLAN.md`

**A4 Moderation Center implementation update (2026-07-15):** เพิ่ม Moderation
Center แบบ case-based หลัง feature flag `MODERATION_CENTER_ENABLED=1` แล้ว รองรับ
report aggregation/dedup สำหรับ Announcement, Material, Assignment, Comment,
File Attachment และ Profile Image; มี immutable snapshot, event timeline,
temporary hide/quarantine, restore, resolve/dismiss และ one-time owner appeal.
ข้อจำกัดถูก enforce ที่ Feed/detail, signed-file route, attachment projection และ
profile-image delivery โดยไม่แตะคะแนน การเข้าเรียน submission หรือสิทธิ์สอนของ
Admin. Additive migration ลงเฉพาะ Neon QA, integration flow ผ่าน 1/1 และ policy
unit ผ่าน 5/5; Production migrate และ deploy code แล้วเมื่อ 2026-07-15 แต่ flag
ยังปิด รอ Vercel environment cutover พร้อม manual theme/mobile/private-R2 acceptance.

**A4 Account Lifecycle implementation update (2026-07-15):** Neon QA ผ่าน
additive migration/backfill แล้ว (latest verifier: `ACTIVE` 12, mismatch 0,
lifecycle history 0 หลัง test cleanup) และเพิ่ม transaction
จริงสำหรับ Suspend/Reactivate: re-check actor/state/last Admin ภายใน Serializable
transaction, sync `accountStatus` + `isActive`, revoke session, เขียน
`AccountLifecycleEvent` และ `AuditLog` แบบ atomic. หน้า Admin user detail มีฟอร์ม
เหตุผลภายใน + ข้อความแจ้งผู้ใช้ + confirmation แล้ว แต่แสดงเฉพาะเมื่อ
`ACCOUNT_LIFECYCLE_MUTATIONS_ENABLED=1`; ค่า default ยังปิด Production migrate
และ deploy code แล้วแต่ยังไม่ enable. QA integration suspend→reactivate ผ่าน 1/1, unit 486/486,
typecheck และ targeted ESLint ผ่าน. ห้าม migrate Production โดยไม่มี approval แยก.

**A0 Documentation Alignment ปิดแล้ว (2026-07-14 · docs only):** ปรับ `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, `docs/PROPOSAL.md`, `docs/DEPLOY.md`, `Task.md` และ roadmap ให้ตรง code/product ปัจจุบัน ไม่มีการแก้ code, schema หรือข้อมูล งานถัดไปตาม roadmap คือ A2 Critical-path QA → A3 Functional Completeness Audit

**A3 static audit ปิด inventory แล้ว (2026-07-14 · read-only):** เพิ่ม `docs/FUNCTIONAL-COMPLETENESS-AUDIT.md` จำแนก Dashboard, Admin user lifecycle, QR/Invite, Moderation และ Profile เป็น Shipped / Intentionally Limited / Deferred / Removed from Proposal พร้อมหลักฐานและลำดับ follow-up โดยยังไม่ได้อ้างว่า deferred capability ถูกพัฒนาเสร็จ งานบังคับก่อน Feature ใหม่ยังเป็น A2 isolated QA → A3.1 correctness → A4 account/content-retention decisions

**A3.1 correctness/UI consistency ปิดแล้ว:** แก้ `getAdminStats()` ให้จำนวนครู/นักเรียนใช้ความหมายเดียวกับหน้ารายการ Admin โดยไม่นับบัญชี soft-delete และ Student ที่ anonymized พร้อม unit regression test; เพิ่ม shared avatar ใน Teacher submission detail และ Teacher member management ส่วนตารางคะแนน/เช็กชื่อคง text-first และ Student peer list คง L1 projection ที่ไม่เปิด userId

**A4 Account Lifecycle + Content Retention decision lock ปิดแล้ว (2026-07-14 · docs only):** ตกลง Account Status กลาง `ACTIVE / SUSPENDED / TERMINATED / ANONYMIZED`, คำขอยุติบัญชี, self/last-Admin protection, Teacher active-course guard, Student withdrawal/history preservation และ irreversible anonymization แล้ว รวมทั้งตกลงสร้าง Moderation Center แบบ case-based มี report aggregation, temporary hide, quarantine, restore และ one-time appeal; published/used entities ใช้ archive/soft-delete แทน hard-delete และ moderation ห้ามกระทบคะแนน งานถัดไปต้องเริ่มจาก Neon QA branch + backup/restore rehearsal ก่อน schema หรือ data mutation ดู ADR-0031, ADR-0032 และ `docs/MODERATION-CONTENT-MATRIX.md`

**A0.1 Compatibility Cleanup ปิดแล้ว (2026-07-14):** ลบ Ink+Gold CSS compatibility shims ที่ไม่มี consumer, ลบ `weightedTotal`/`Weighted*` migration aliases และใช้ `scoreTotal` เป็นชื่อเดียว, ลบ `R2_PUBLIC_URL`, ถอด dependency Three.js/R3F และ type stubs ที่ไม่มี import, เปลี่ยน package name เป็น `beagle-classroom`, เปลี่ยน `middleware.ts` ที่ deprecated เป็น `proxy.ts` ตาม Next.js 16 และเก็บ unused import/test variable ที่ ESLint พบ ไม่มี schema/data command; typecheck, unit 429/429 และ production build ผ่าน

**A1 Report/Export v1 ปิดแล้ว (2026-07-14 · ไม่มี schema/data mutation):**
- เพิ่ม Teacher course score summary CSV ที่หน้า Scores: มี Score Item ทุกช่อง, สถานะร่าง/ประกาศ, คะแนนรวมจากรายการที่ประกาศ, %, และเกรดรายวิชา
- เพิ่ม Teacher course attendance summary CSV ที่หน้า Attendance: มา/สาย/ลา/ขาด/ยังไม่เช็ก/เช็กแล้ว/คาบทั้งหมด/% รายคน
- ทั้งสอง route บังคับ `ownsCourse` และ query ยืนยัน owner ซ้ำ; Admin/Student/ครูคนอื่น export ไม่ได้
- CSV เป็น UTF-8 BOM + RFC 4180, ป้องกัน formula injection, `private, no-store`, และทุก export บันทึก `CLASS_ANALYTICS_EXPORTED` ระดับ Important
- Student Learning Results ใช้ browser Print/PDF ต่อไป; Admin Audit ใช้ filtered CSV; server-generated Report Card PDF เลื่อนไป release ภายหลังอย่างชัดเจน
- Unit/permission/route tests สำหรับงานนี้ผ่าน 81/81; งานถัดไปคือ A2 Critical-path QA gate

**A2 Critical-path QA gate เริ่มแล้ว (2026-07-14 · ยังไม่ปิดงาน):**
- Audit พบว่า Integration และ Playwright เดิมโหลด `DATABASE_URL` จาก `.env.local` แล้วสร้าง/ลบข้อมูลจริง ซึ่งไม่ปลอดภัยเพราะ dev=prod ใช้ Neon เดียวกัน
- เพิ่ม fail-closed runner: `test:integration`, `test:all`, `test:e2e` ต้องมี `QA_DATABASE_URL` ที่เป็นฐานหรือ Neon branch แยก และจะบล็อก pooled/direct URL ของ branch เดียวกัน รวมถึงการข้าม runner
- เพิ่ม `pnpm qa:safe` สำหรับ anonymous read-only HTTP smoke; ไม่ login และไม่แก้ข้อมูล
- เพิ่ม regression tests สำหรับ database safety, Profile display-name fallback และ System/Dark/Cream theme contract
- ปรับ `Testing.md` ให้ตรงระบบจริงแล้ว; ห้ามรัน mutating suites จนกว่าจะมี QA DB แยก
- งานที่ยังเหลือก่อนปิด A2: provision QA DB, รัน Integration/E2E ที่ฐานนั้น, manual role/privacy/mobile/theme checklist และ production private-R2 upload/preview smoke
- รอบนี้ไม่มี schema command, backfill หรือ data mutation และ Lesson Workspace ยังเป็น Prototype เท่านั้น
- Playwright บังคับเปิด QA server แยกที่ port `3100` และ `reuseExistingServer: false` เพื่อไม่ให้ browser test ไปใช้ dev server port 3000 ที่ยังต่อ primary DB
- Verification หลัง A3.1 ล่าสุด: typecheck ผ่าน, unit `454/454`, safe HTTP smoke `10/10`, targeted Admin Dashboard regression ผ่าน, ESLint เฉพาะไฟล์ A3.1 ผ่าน, production build ผ่าน และตรวจแล้วว่า `test:integration`, `dev:qa` และ `test:smoke` หยุดก่อนเริ่มเมื่อไม่มี `QA_DATABASE_URL`; QA server ถูกแยกไว้ที่พอร์ต `3100`

ลำดับที่ตกลงล่าสุด:
1. ปรับเอกสาร Core ให้ตรง code จริง: sum-based scoring, Admin read-only observer, Profile/Theme, Dashboard, Feed/Notification และ private file delivery
2. ✅ ปิดขอบเขต Report/Export v1: Student Print/PDF + Teacher score/attendance CSV + Admin Audit CSV; Report Card PDF แบบ server-generated เลื่อนไปภายหลัง
3. ทำ Critical-path QA gate: สมัคร/เข้าห้อง/โพสต์/ส่งงาน/ตรวจงาน/เผยแพร่คะแนน/เช็คชื่อ/อัปโหลดไฟล์ + role/privacy/theme/mobile/prod R2
4. ทำ Lesson Workspace แบบ additive + feature flag + dry-run/backfill ก่อนเปลี่ยน navigation
5. ทำ Quiz หลัง Lesson Workspace เพราะ Quiz ต้องสังกัด Lesson และใช้ Score Item contract เดิม
6. ตรวจ identity/integration แยกต่างหาก: Google Login ต้องออกแบบ account linking ก่อน; integration อื่นต้องระบุระบบปลายทางจริง
7. AI assistance เป็นลำดับท้าย และต้องมี human confirmation, privacy และ audit decisions ก่อน

**Completion audit ที่ห้ามเรียกว่า "ครบ" จนกว่าจะตรวจรับ:** Dashboard trends/usage, Admin user deactivate/anonymize lifecycle, QR/invite E2E, moderation matrix ทุก content type และขอบเขต Profile personal information

**ยังไม่ทำจริง:** Quiz, AI, Google Login, Chat Room, Reward, Meeting และ external integration นอก CSV/R2 ส่วน Subscription/global multi-tenant เป็น product track แยกจาก single-tenant school app นี้

**Prototype reference (dev-only):**
- Teacher = Variant B split workspace
- Student = Variant C learning path + checkpoints
- Teacher lesson detail prototype มี structured sections และปุ่ม "เปิดพื้นที่บทเรียน"
- ชื่อ Lesson เป็น free-form; ไม่บังคับ "บทที่ 1"
- Route prototype ต้องคง production 404 จนกว่าจะอนุมัติ implementation

**Domain/architecture decision:** `docs/adr/0030-lesson-workspace-default-structure-feed-remains-timeline.md` บันทึกว่า Lesson Workspace จะเป็นโครงสร้างหลักในอนาคต ส่วน Feed ยังอยู่เป็น chronological timeline และ URL/ข้อมูลเดิมต้องไม่หาย

## 🆕 SESSION 2026-06-16 · classroom flows fixes + submission version hide

> branch `phase-11` · pushed `5aef1fc..2043759` (5 commits) · working tree clean · typecheck/lint/unit (429) green

**Shipped (each its own commit):**
- `fix(admin)` — restored the **"ห้องเรียนทั้งหมด"** sidebar link (lost in `d0bdbf5`, which only meant to hide the dashboard gallery; `/admin/classes` page existed all along).
- `feat(feed)` — announcement & material **detail pages now render file/image/link attachments** (they only fetched `linkUrls` before). New `lib/storage/attachments.ts` + `components/course/post-detail.tsx` (reuses the feed `FeedAttachmentPreview` + lightbox); all 4 student/teacher pages thinned onto it.
- `fix(feed)` — teacher composer **no longer 500-crashes on a bad link**; `ZodError → fieldErrors` renders inline under the links field.
- `feat(submission)` — students can **soft-hide a past version** from their own history (`SubmissionVersion.hiddenFromStudentAt`; teacher + audit still see it — ADR-0020). New `hideSubmissionVersion` mutation + `SUBMISSION_VERSION_HIDDEN` audit + `HideVersionButton`. Renamed **"เวอร์ชัน N" → "การส่งครั้งที่ N"**. Also fixed `submitVersion`'s ValidationError key (`path.join(".")` → `path[0]`) so an invalid submission link surfaces as `fieldErrors.links` (was silently `"links.0"`).

**🟥 Must-know for next session / Codex:**
1. **DB schema changed via `db push`** (added `SubmissionVersion.hiddenFromStudentAt`, nullable). Since **dev = prod share one Neon DB**, the column is **already on prod's DB** (additive/safe). Prod *code* gets it on the next `phase-11 → main` PR.
2. **Migrations are drift-locked** — only `init_auth` exists; everything since is `db push`. `prisma migrate dev` wants to **reset (drop all data)** → **do NOT run it**; use `pnpm db:push`.
3. **After any `db push` / schema change: delete `.next` + restart the dev server.** Turbopack bundles a stale Prisma client → this session a stale client made the assignment-detail query throw and render a phantom **404**. `rm -rf .next` + restart fixed it.
4. A 404 on `/student/courses/<c>/assignments/<a>` for an account **not enrolled** in that course is **by design** (L1 enrollment guard), not a bug.
5. **Landing**: `app/page.tsx` + `components/landing/*` currently **match `5aef1fc`** (no uncommitted landing changes). This session explored landing redesigns (orbit "how-it-works", aurora section, grid background, real-component showcase) but those are **not in the tree** — confirm with Codex whether that redesign should be present before redoing.
6. **`CLAUDE.md` "Design System — Ink + Gold" is stale** — the live theme is **Calm Ledger v2** (ADR-0028, System Blue; gold retired in `globals.css`). Worth updating that section.
7. Installed `taste` skill (`~/.claude/skills/taste`) + **Playwright MCP** (user config) — needs a Claude Code restart to activate.

## 🔥 LATEST UPDATE — 2026-06-13 · Beagle Classroom current state

> อ่าน section นี้ก่อน เพราะข้อมูลด้านล่างบางส่วนเป็น handoff เก่าจากหลาย phase และอาจไม่ตรงกับสถานะล่าสุดทั้งหมด

### Repo / branch state

- Repo หลักที่กำลังทำงาน: `D:\Studennnn`
- Commit ล่าสุด: `5b82622 feat(mobile): replace 4-item bottom nav with a single floating action button`
- ✅ **(2026-06-13) mobile FAB commit แล้ว** — working tree สะอาด ไม่มี uncommitted
  - `5b82622` FAB · `8224f79` CONTEXT Class rule · `4acb97d`/`45fcdf7` HANDOFF · `1c1e835` turnstile test fix
- Validation หลัง FAB (40px):
  - `pnpm typecheck` ผ่าน · `pnpm lint` 0 error · `pnpm test` 429/429
- Validation ก่อนหน้าในชุดงานเดียวกัน:
  - `npm.cmd run typecheck` ผ่าน
  - `npm.cmd run lint` ผ่านแบบมี warning เดิมจำนวนมาก แต่ไม่มี error
  - `npm.cmd run build` ผ่าน

### ✅ Health ล่าสุด (verified 2026-06-13 by Claude — รันจริง)

| เช็ค | ผล |
|------|-----|
| `pnpm typecheck` | **0 errors** |
| `pnpm lint` | **0 errors** · 255 warnings (baseline เดิม · `c2 unused` อยู่ใน `tests/unit/scoring-term-gpa.test.ts` ไม่เกี่ยว FAB) |
| `pnpm build` | **ผ่าน** |
| `pnpm test` (unit) | **428/429 ผ่าน** — ดู "Known issue" ด้านล่าง |

**⚠️ Known issue — unit test fail 1 ตัว (ไม่ใช่ regression ของงานใหม่):**
`tests/unit/validation.test.ts > SignupStudentSchema > rejects without turnstile token`
— test เก่าคาดว่า `turnstileToken: ""` ต้อง reject แต่ schema ถูกตั้งใจแก้เป็น
`z.string().optional().default("")` ตั้งแต่ commit `e25421a` (แก้ signup deadlock ตอน Turnstile ไม่ได้ตั้ง key)
→ **ต้องแก้/ลบ test ให้ตรง schema ใหม่ ไม่ใช่แก้ schema** เป็น stale test ตกค้างเท่านั้น

### 🗂️ Feature ledger — งานถึงไหนแล้ว (commit → ฟีเจอร์, ใหม่→เก่า)

**DONE + committed บน `phase-11`:**

| Commit | ฟีเจอร์ | สถานะ verify |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| `028e2a5` | Course feed/workflow, assignment submission UX, file upload+preview (`/api/storage/files/[fileId]`), not-found page, link handling | typecheck/lint/build ผ่าน |
| `a958791` | Theme bootstrap render ผ่าน `next/script` (กัน flash) | — |
| `d0bdbf5` | ซ่อน class gallery ออกจาก admin dashboard | — |
| `ee7988b` | ครูสร้าง **class label** เองตอนสร้างวิชา (`lib/course/create-course.ts`) | — |
| `02c7f4b` | **Teacher** แยกหน้า scores / attendance ออกจาก overview | — |
| `f8a7871` `0ca9ece` `bd67bcf` | **Admin Observer View (read-only)** — `/admin/classes` index + `/admin/courses/[id]` (feed/assignments/attendance/members/scores) ⚠️ HANDOFF เก่าเขียนว่า "ยังไม่ implement" — **ตอนนี้ทำแล้ว** | — |
| `b91fb11` `f0c71de` `914a571` | Admin nav reorg + teachers page = management hub + `/admin/teachers/new` + student management actions | — |
| `c746bc0` `94778e3` `dc34c0d` | **Batch 1+2: Profile + Theme/Dark mode** (displayName fallback, avatar crop 512² upload/delete + audit, change password, 4 โหมด SYSTEM/LIGHT/DARK/CREAM, transition 180ms, ไม่ audit theme) | Claude verify ครบ + QA browser |
| `52165cb` `9dedb13` `898b3ee` `266a538` | Dashboard reshape 3 role, student assignment workspace, `SUBMISSION_WITHDRAWN` audit, per-course grade mental model | Claude verify |

**DONE (committed `5b82622`):** mobile FAB nav — แทน bottom nav 4 เมนูด้วยปุ่ม `+` 40px (student→/join, teacher→/teacher/courses/new) · working tree สะอาดแล้ว

**ยังไม่ทำ / debt ที่ Codex เลือกหยิบได้:**
- Profile/Theme = **0 test coverage** (47 test files ไม่มีตัวไหนครอบ `lib/profile/*`, `lib/theme/*`, presign PROFILE_IMAGE scope guard, displayName fallback)
- Teacher notification ตอนนักเรียน withdraw — ต้องเพิ่มค่าใน `NotificationKind` enum (Prisma migration)
- Dark mode QA — ยังไม่ไล่ contrast WCAG AA ทุกหน้า + หน้า `/login` ใน 4 โหมด
- `components/dashboard/teacher-hero.tsx` อาจไม่ถูกใช้แล้ว (เช็คก่อนลบ)
- Security: rotate DB password + admin password (หลุดในแชต)

### 🔍 Codex deep-read — อ่าน diff จริงทุก commit (Claude, 2026-06-13)

งานที่ Codex (`Rayxls`) เขียนต่อจากงาน profile/theme ของ Claude (`c746bc0..028e2a5`, 11 commits)
— ไล่อ่าน diff จริงแล้ว ไม่ใช่แค่ commit message:

**🟥 DOMAIN CHANGE ที่ต้องระวัง — `ee7988b` "ครูสร้าง class labels"**
- `lib/course/create-course.ts`: ตัด param `classId` ออก, เพิ่ม `roomName` — ตอนสร้างวิชา **ครู upsert `Class` เองได้แล้ว** (`academicYearId_name` unique → create-or-reuse) ผ่าน `normalizeGradeLevel` + `normalizeRoomName` + `formatClassName`
- ⚠️ **ขัดกับ CONTEXT.md เดิม** ที่เขียนว่า "Class โรงเรียนกำหนด — ไม่ใช่ครูสร้างเอง" → **CONTEXT.md ยังไม่อัปเดต** ต้องตัดสินใจ: แก้ doc ให้ตรง code หรือ revert behavior
- `lib/validation/course.ts` เปลี่ยน schema รับ `roomName` แทน `classId`

**Admin features ใหม่ (ส่วนใหญ่ของงาน Codex):**
- `914a571` — admin sidebar reorg
- `f0c71de` — `/admin/teachers` = **management hub** + `/admin/teachers/new` (`createTeacherAction` + reveal-once temp password ผ่าน flash cookie `lib/admin/teacher-created-flash.ts` + redirect pattern)
- `b91fb11` — `/admin/students` เพิ่มคอลัมน์ "จัดการ" = ลิงก์ **ดูข้อมูล + Reset Password** (เป็น `<Link>` อย่างเดียว ✅ ไม่ใช่ data input — ยังตรงกฎ "Admin ไม่ใส่ข้อมูล")
- `bd67bcf` — `/admin/classes` index (335 บรรทัด) + `/admin/courses/[id]` base
- `0ca9ece` — **Admin Course Observer (read-only)** — `app/admin/courses/[id]/layout.tsx` มี badge "Admin Observer · อ่านอย่างเดียว", tabs (`_tabs.ts`): ภาพรวม/ฟีด/สมาชิก/เช็คชื่อ/คะแนน/งาน/ตั้งค่า — admin ดูได้เหมือนครูแต่ไม่มี mutation
- `f8a7871` — observer: แยกหน้า scores/attendance เป็น page ของตัวเอง
- `d0bdbf5` — ลบ class gallery (251 บรรทัด) ออกจาก `/admin/dashboard` + 2 บรรทัดใน sidebar

**Teacher:**
- `02c7f4b` — แยก scores/attendance ออกจาก `overview` (overview เดิม 443 บรรทัดหดลง)

**Theme + storage + misc — `028e2a5` (commit ใหญ่สุด):**
- 🆕 `app/api/storage/files/[fileId]/route.ts` — **serving route auth-gated** (`assertCanReadFile` dispatch ตาม ownerType: SUBMISSION→`canViewSubmission` ฯลฯ) + inline/attachment disposition + local-dev/signed-R2 · runtime nodejs · cache-control private
- `app/globals.css` +47 บรรทัด — CSS class theme-aware (`.assignment-brief-panel`, `.comment-*-social`) ใช้ `color-mix` + token → **dark-mode ใช้ได้** (เดิม light-only gradient)
- `app/not-found.tsx` ใหม่, assignment detail polish, `app/admin/setup/actions.ts`
- `a958791` — theme bootstrap `<script>` → next `<Script>` (กัน hydration/flash)

**สรุป gotchas สำหรับ session หน้า:**
1. ครูสร้าง Class เองได้แล้ว (upsert) — ขัด CONTEXT.md เดิม, doc ยังไม่ตาม
2. ไฟล์ทุกชนิด serve ผ่าน `/api/storage/files/[fileId]` (auth-gated) — อย่าทำ public URL
3. Admin = observer read-only ที่ `/admin/courses/[id]` — ห้ามเผลอใส่ mutation ฝั่ง admin
4. มี `Class.academicYearId_name` unique constraint ที่ create-course พึ่งพา

### Mobile navigation decision ล่าสุด

ผู้ใช้ไม่ต้องการ mobile bottom nav แบบ 4 เมนูแล้ว:

- เอา `ฟีด / ห้องเรียน / ผลการเรียน / แจ้งเตือน` ออกจาก bottom nav
- ให้เหลือปุ่ม `+` กลางล่างจอเท่านั้น
- ขนาดล่าสุดที่ผู้ใช้ขอ: `40px`
- นักเรียนกด `+` → ไป `/join` เพื่อเข้าร่วมชั้นเรียน
- ครูกด `+` → ไป `/teacher/courses/new` เพื่อสร้างห้องเรียน
- หน้า `/dashboard` render FAB สำหรับทั้ง `STUDENT` และ `TEACHER`
- หน้า `/teacher/courses` render FAB สำหรับครูด้วย
- หน้า `/student/courses` ใช้ default student FAB อยู่แล้ว

Implementation:

- `components/layout/student-bottom-nav.tsx`
  - component เดิมชื่อ `StudentBottomNav` ถูกเปลี่ยนจาก 4-item nav เป็น single centered FAB
  - รับ prop `role?: "student" | "teacher"`
  - ใช้ `h-10 w-10` และ icon `h-5 w-5`
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx`
  - เพิ่ม mobile spacer และ FAB สำหรับ Student/Teacher
- `app/teacher/courses/page.tsx`
  - เพิ่ม FAB role teacher และ mobile spacer

### Product direction / decisions ที่ควรถือเป็น source ล่าสุด

- ระบบยังเป็น role-based: Student / Teacher / Admin
- ผู้ใช้อยากให้ UX ไม่งงระหว่างนักเรียนกับครู
- Student dashboard และ Teacher dashboard ควรเป็น professional operating dashboard ไม่ใช่ activity feed
- Course cards เป็น surface สำคัญกลาง Dashboard และ course list
- Admin ไม่ควรต้องสร้างห้องเรียนรายห้องแทนครู
- ครูควรสร้าง/จัดการห้องเรียนเอง
- Admin ควรเห็น overview และ observer/read-only view ของข้อมูลได้ เหมือนเป็นครูอีกคน แต่ซ่อน action ที่ทำไม่ได้
- Activity ล่าสุดไม่ควรอยู่ใน dashboard หลัก ให้ไปอยู่ใน Audit / Activity Review
- Profile/avatar ใช้รูปจริงได้ แต่ตอนนี้มี default/shared avatar ได้ก่อน
- Theme:
  - default เป็น System
  - ไม่มี accent color option
  - Dark mode ต้องระวัง contrast สีเทากับ text
- External URL/link ควรเปิด browser tab ใหม่ ไม่พา Beagle Classroom ไปหน้า external ใน tab เดิม
- Assignment detail:
  - Feed card ไม่ต้องโชว์รูปใหญ่
  - detail page ควรโชว์รายละเอียดงาน/รูป/ไฟล์เต็มกว่า feed
  - การส่งงานควร refresh/ให้ feedback ชัดเจนว่าส่งแล้ว

### Recent committed scope in `028e2a5`

Commit `028e2a5` รวมงานใหญ่หลายส่วน:

- Course feed UX และ workflow
- Assignment submission UX
- Teacher/student attachment upload and preview
- Preview modal / file preview improvements
- Link handling improvements
- Dashboard/course card changes
- Admin/teacher observer/read-only related improvements
- Profile/theme polish
- QA ผ่าน typecheck/lint/build ก่อน commit

ใช้คำสั่งนี้ดูรายละเอียดแทนการคัด diff ยาวในเอกสาร:

```bash
git show --stat 028e2a5
git show --name-only 028e2a5
```

### Next step ที่ Claude ควรทำทันที

1. ตรวจ 3 uncommitted files ด้านบน
2. QA mobile Student และ Teacher:
   - Student mobile dashboard เหลือ `+` เดียว → `/join`
   - Teacher mobile dashboard เหลือ `+` เดียว → `/teacher/courses/new`
   - ไม่มี bottom nav 4 เมนู
3. Run:

```bash
npm.cmd run typecheck
npm.cmd run lint
npm.cmd run build
```

4. ถ้าผู้ใช้โอเค ให้ commit งาน mobile FAB ชุดนี้

### Suggested skills for Claude/Codex continuation

- `build-web-apps:frontend-testing-debugging` สำหรับ QA UI/mobile
- `browser:control-in-app-browser` สำหรับทดสอบ localhost และ screenshot
- `build-web-apps:react-best-practices` เมื่อแก้ React/Next component
- `grill-with-docs` เมื่อต้องคุย decision ใหม่และอัปเดตเอกสาร
- `diagnose` เมื่อเจอบัค UI/console/hydration

อัพเดตล่าสุด: **2026-06-10** · branch `phase-11` (merged → `main`) · **LIVE บน production** (Vercel) · Codex changes ค้าง uncommitted

---

## ⚠️ START HERE — Session resume point (2026-06-10 · LIVE production trial)

### 🚀 Production (deployed, ใช้งานจริงได้)
- **URL:** `https://studen-project.vercel.app` (Vercel project `studen-project`, team `rayzxls' projects`)
- **DB:** Neon `neondb` (`ep-wild-scene-ao2ft9vq-pooler` · ap-southeast-1) — **dev = prod อันเดียวกัน** (ผู้ใช้เลือกใช้ตัวนี้เป็น prod)
- **Admin คนเดียว:** identifier `Rayzxls` / pwd `Rayzxls0088` (สร้างผ่าน `pnpm db:reset-admin` — DB ถูกล้างเหลือ admin เดียว)
- **Env บน Vercel:** `DATABASE_URL` (+`connect_timeout`), `AUTH_SECRET`, `AUTH_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` · Turnstile/Upstash **ไม่ได้ตั้ง** (signup ทำงานได้เพราะแก้ให้ optional)
- **`main` = source of truth ของ deploy** (Vercel auto-deploy on push to main). phase-11 merged เข้า main ผ่าน PR #1/#2/#3

### งานที่ปิดไปแล้ว (merged → main, deployed)
- Immersive UI (mascot + classroom webp), Feed-default course shell, assignment submit-first-visit fix, **teacher reference links บน assignment** (+ `Assignment.linkUrls` JSON column — db push แล้ว), composer link attachments + redesign
- Deploy tooling: `prisma/bootstrap.ts` (`db:bootstrap`), `prisma/reset-to-admin.ts` (`db:reset-admin`), `docs/DEPLOY.md`
- Auth hotfixes (deployed): **Turnstile optional เมื่อไม่ตั้ง key** (client button + `verifyTurnstile` skip + `SignupStudentSchema.turnstileToken` optional) — แก้ signup deadlock

### ⏳ Codex changes — **ยัง uncommitted** (typecheck 0 · lint 0)
อีก agent (Codex) เขียนเพิ่มในเครื่อง ยังไม่ commit/ยังไม่ deploy:
- **withdrawSubmission** — นักเรียนยกเลิกการส่ง (`lib/assignment/submission.ts` + `withdrawSubmissionAction` + `components/assignment/withdraw-submission-button.tsx`). authz ครบ
  - ✅ **(2026-06-10) audit เพิ่มแล้ว:** `SUBMISSION_WITHDRAWN` (Important · เพิ่มเฉพาะ TS union — ไม่มี migration เพราะ `AuditLog.action` เป็น String) + sync label.ts/tier.ts/Security.md · block withdraw เมื่อสถานะ `RETURNED` (path ที่ถูกคือแก้แล้วส่งใหม่) · UI เปลี่ยนเป็น inline confirm panel (เลิกใช้ `window.confirm`)
  - ⏳ **teacher notification ยังไม่มี** — ต้องเพิ่มค่าใหม่ใน `NotificationKind` enum (Prisma migration) จึงตัดสินใจเลื่อน; ครูเห็นผลทาง review queue (งานหายจากคิวรอตรวจ) + audit log
- **Student Assignment Workspace** — รื้อ `app/student/courses/[id]/assignments/[assignmentId]/page.tsx` เป็น 2 โซน (โพสต์ครู+คอมเมนต์ห้อง / panel ส่งงาน). ensureSubmission + linkUrls เดิมยังอยู่
- **CommentsThread** variant `social` (IG-style) + composer
- **Landing**: ลบ `components/landing/hero-scene.tsx` + เอา R3F/WebGL ออกจาก `immersive-3d.tsx` → CSS cards (perf)
- **CONTEXT.md**: เพิ่ม domain — Admin Observer View, Submission Conversation/Answer, Student Assignment Workspace, Assignment Review Workspace
- ⚠️ **doc ล้ำหน้า code:** "Admin Observer View" + "Assignment Review Workspace" เขียนใน CONTEXT.md แต่ **ยังไม่ได้ implement** (diff ไม่มีหน้า teacher/admin)
- ⚠️ ไฟล์ขยะ untracked ควร `.gitignore`: `.codex/`, `next-dev-*.log`, `vite-dev-*.log`

### ✅ งานที่ปิดในเครื่องแล้ว (2026-06-10 — committed บน phase-11, รอ PR → main)
- **Assignment Review Workspace (teacher)** — master-detail 3 คอลัมน์ที่ `/teacher/courses/[id]/assignments/[assignmentId]` (`?filter=` + `?sid=`), `quickGradeAndAdvanceAction`/`returnAndAdvanceAction` redirect ไปคิวถัดไป, `components/assignment/review-panel.tsx`
- **Dashboard reshape ทั้ง 3 role** — operating dashboard ไม่ใช่ feed:
  - lib ใหม่ `lib/dashboard/action-center.ts` (student returned/due/recent-scores · teacher review-queue/attendance-today/class-health)
  - primitives ใหม่ `components/dashboard/primitives.tsx` (SectionHeader/MetricTile/ActionRow/CourseQuickLink/EmptyState) + `student-action-center.tsx` + `teacher-ops.tsx`
  - `/dashboard`: student = hero+summary chips + Action Center (ส่งคืน>งานต้องส่ง>feed) + aside (วันนี้/คะแนนล่าสุด/ห้องเรียน) · teacher = KPI 4 ตัว + Review Queue + Class Health + เช็คชื่อวันนี้ · admin = doorway
  - `/admin/dashboard`: operational alerts (ไม่มี timeline แล้ว) + MetricTile + งานผู้ดูแล/การตรวจสอบ · class cards คงเดิม
  - **หน้าใหม่ `/admin/activity`** (กิจกรรมในระบบ — แยกจาก Audit Log) + sidebar item · filter: ประเภท/วิชา/ช่วงเวลา · TODO: actor filter + pagination (รอ activity query module)
  - `components/dashboard/teacher-hero.tsx` ไม่ถูกใช้แล้ว (ยังไม่ลบ)

### ⏭️ NEXT
- PR phase-11 → main → auto-deploy
- withdraw: audit ✅ แล้ว — เหลือ teacher notification (ต้องเพิ่ม `NotificationKind` + migration ถ้าจะทำ)
- Activity Review: actor filter + pagination + ย้าย query ไป lib module
- Implement "Admin Observer View" ให้ตรง CONTEXT.md (หรือถอน doc ออกถ้ายังไม่ทำ)
- Perf: เว็บช้า — สาเหตุหลักคาดว่า Neon free-tier scale-to-zero (cold start) + Vercel↔Neon region + force-dynamic ทุกหน้า (ยังไม่ได้ตรวจ region จริง)
- หมุนรหัส: DB password + admin password หลุดในแชต → ควร rotate

## START HERE (เดิม) — Session resume point (2026-06-06 · branch `phase-11`, HEAD `f63b448`)

ทั้งหมดอยู่บน branch **`phase-11`** (pushed to origin, 59 commits ยังไม่ merge เข้า `main`). typecheck 0 · lint 0 (254 pre-existing warnings) · tests 429 passing. ยังไม่มี schema migration ใน Phase 11/12.

### สถานะล่าสุด — Beagle Classroom rebrand + landing + 3D polish

แอปถูก rebrand **Studennnn → Beagle Classroom** (UI surfaces ครบ; seed emails `@studennnn.local` ยังเป็น DB key เดิม โดยตั้งใจ).

**Brand assets** (`public/brand/`):
- `beagle-mark.png` — logo mark โปร่งใส (nav/footer ทุกหน้าผ่าน `BeagleLogo`)
- `icon.png` — squircle (favicon: `app/icon.png` 512 + `app/apple-icon.png` 180 + `app/favicon.ico`)
- `cloud-banner.webp` (25KB) — เมฆพาสเทล ใช้เป็น banner ของ admin class cards
- `beagle-avatar.webp` (164KB, โปร่งใส) — 3D beagle avatar ใน class cards
- `mark-512.png`, `wordmark.png` — เก็บไว้ (wordmark ไม่ได้ใช้; เรา typeset เอง)
- ไฟล์ `.tmp-logo-crop.py`/source PNGs ลบแล้ว

**Landing (`app/page.tsx` = Beagle Classroom):**
1. Hero = FloatingCards (CSS การ์ดลอย parallax + dotted bg + glow) — `components/landing/floating-cards.tsx`
2. `#overview` = รูป ChronoTask (`/landing/hero-cards.webp`) + `ProductMockup` กลาง — `components/landing/product-mockup.tsx`
3. `#features` = bento — `components/landing/showcase-bento.tsx`
4. Immersive 3D = R3F glass crystal + sparkles บนพื้นเข้ม — `components/landing/immersive-3d.tsx` + `hero-scene.tsx`
5. Roles · CTA · Footer

**Admin dashboard class cards** (`app/admin/dashboard/page.tsx` → `ClassCard`): profile-card style เหมือน reference — cloud banner + course-color tint, **3D beagle avatar** ใน gradient ring + float animation, divider stats, tilt + stagger.

### Logo prompts (ถ้าจะ regen) — อยู่ใน chat session นี้; Midjourney/DALL·E

### ⏭️ NEXT — ทำต่อได้เลย (ยังไม่ทำ)

| งาน | รายละเอียด |
|------|-----------|
| **Class detail header consistency** | `/admin/classes/[id]` header ยังเป็น gradient + house icon เก่า — ยังไม่ได้อัปเป็น cloud + beagle avatar ให้ตรงกับ dashboard card (ผู้ใช้ค้างถามว่าจะอัปไหม) |
| **Beagle avatar + cloud → student/teacher dashboard hero** | เอา mascot + เมฆ ไปใช้ที่ hero ของ /dashboard ให้ brand consistent |
| **Merge `phase-11` → `main`** | 59 commits ผ่าน PR + CI (ยังไม่ merge) |
| **Phase 9 cont.** | Hardening + Deploy (deferred) |
| **Phase 13** | `Class.colorSlot Int?` + `Student.heroBgPreset Int?` schema migration |
| **Phase 10 deferred** | per-class analytics + Audit CSV Thai column · composer multi-image · inline grade · 301 redirects |

### Tooling ติดตั้งใน session นี้ (เครื่อง dev)
- `uipro-cli` (global) + skill `.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/` (search CLI ใช้ Python)
- Python 3.12 (winget) + Pillow + numpy (สำหรับ crop logo/แปลง webp)
- deps: `framer-motion` 12.40, `three` 0.184 + `@react-three/fiber` 9.6 + `@react-three/drei` 10.7 + `@types/three`

### Seed credentials (verify ในเบราว์เซอร์)
- Admin: `admin@studennnn.local` / `Admin1234!`
- Teacher: `teacher@studennnn.local` / `Teacher1234!` (homeroom ม.4/2)
- Student: `60001` / `Student1234`

### Motion system ที่ต้องรู้ (ADR-0028 + ADR-0029)
- Primitives: `components/motion/` = `Tilt3D` (CSS 3D, ห้ามใช้ใน data-entry/ห้ามใส่ใน grid item ที่เป็น inline `<a>` — ต้อง `block`), `EntryStagger` (framer), `AmbientBackground` (CSS blobs), `.springy`
- **บทเรียนสำคัญ:** `.card` บน `<a>` ที่ไม่ใช่ direct grid item + ไม่มี `flex`/`block` → จะกลายเป็น `display:inline` แล้วพื้นหลังแตก (ต้องใส่ `block`)
- R3F = landing เท่านั้น (lazy, ssr:false). อย่าใส่ WebGL หลาย canvas ในหน้าเดียว (limit ~16 + GPU)
- ทุก effect ต้อง respect `prefers-reduced-motion`

## Phase 12 Landing Page + Beagle Classroom rebrand (2026-06-06 · branch `phase-11`)

**Branch:** `phase-11` (pushed) — Phase 12 = R3F landing + rebrand. App is being renamed **Studennnn → Beagle Classroom** (family: beagle lovers + ครู/ข้าราชการครู). Rebrand applied on the landing page; **global rename across all `Studennnn` strings is a pending follow-up** (not yet done — login/dashboard/nav/footer/emails still say Studennnn).

### What Phase 12 ships

**Real 3D (ADR-0029 T1 Showcase).** Installed `three` + `@react-three/fiber` + `@react-three/drei` (landing-only, lazy via `next/dynamic ssr:false`). No WebGL bundle on authenticated pages.

- `components/landing/hero-scene.tsx` — R3F Canvas: floating glossy brand-coloured shapes (distorted icosahedron + sphere, rounded box, torus, dodecahedron) drifting via `<Float>`, leaning to the pointer, lit by an orbiting point light + city environment (liquid-glass read). Abstract, no model assets.
- `components/landing/hero-canvas.tsx` — client wrapper: lazy-loads HeroScene, gates on `prefers-reduced-motion`, always paints a static brand-gradient fallback.
- `components/landing/floating-cards.tsx` — ChronoTask-style product mini-cards (score 92%, attendance ring, due reminder, feed post, submissions 8/10) at varied depths, pointer-parallax + idle bob. Mobile-hidden, reduced-motion-off.
- `components/landing/showcase-bento.tsx` — Apple-style bento (col-span 4/2/2/4/3/3) of live-styled mocks of real surfaces (gradebook bars, 88% attendance ring, feed posts, course-colour grid, audit copy, role KPIs). Tilt3D per tile. **Plain grid, not EntryStagger** (so each Tilt3D is the direct grid item and col-spans resolve — same wrapper lesson as the dashboard cards).
- `components/landing/beagle-logo.tsx` — temporary SVG brand mark (beagle head + drop ears + graduation cap) + BeagleWordmark. **Swap for the AI-generated logo when ready** — API (className) stays the same. Logo prompt delivered in chat.
- `app/page.tsx` — full landing rewrite: glass nav, hero (Section 1), bento (Section 2), 3-role strip, saturated-blue closing CTA, footer.

### Bug fixed this phase (important pattern)

**Tilt3D + inline anchor clip.** Wrapping a `.card` `<a>` in Tilt3D removed its grid-item auto-blockification → the anchor reverted to `display:inline` → fragmented background + content spill (product owner screenshotted it). Fixed by adding the `block` utility to the student dashboard card anchor. Verified in-browser via preview MCP (logged in as seeded student). **Lesson: any `.card` anchor that is NOT a direct grid item and lacks `flex`/`block` needs an explicit `block`.**

Also: `@react-three/fiber` v9 augments global `JSX.IntrinsicElements` with three's elements, which made `React.ElementType` resolve `className` to `never` for dynamic `<Icon>` in setup-tabs + unified-composer. Fixed by typing those icon fields as `LucideIcon`.

### Phase 12 verifications

- `pnpm typecheck` = **0 errors** · `pnpm lint` = **0 errors** (254 warnings) · `pnpm test` = **429 passed**
- Verified in browser (preview MCP): hero WebGL canvas + floating cards + headline render; bento resolves to varied layout; logged-out landing reachable.

### Seed credentials (for browser verification)

- Admin: `admin@studennnn.local` / `Admin1234!`
- Teacher: `teacher@studennnn.local` / `Teacher1234!` (homeroom ม.4/2)
- Student: `60001` / `Student1234` (in ม.4/2)

## ⚠️ START HERE — Phase 11.8 + 11.9 World-class interactive ปิดครบ (2026-06-06 · branch `phase-11`)

**Branch:** `phase-11` (pushed to origin) — 12 commits on top of Phase 11.7

### Why these phases exist

Product owner pushback after Phase 11.7: (1) the course feed *"เหมือน Gmail ไม่ใช่ Instagram"*, and (2) the whole system *"ดูไม่มีอะไรเลย ไม่มีลูกเล่น Animation"* — wants *"ดูว้าว ดูหรู เป็น OS"* with 2D+3D interactivity from world-class sites. The product owner also asked to install `uipro-cli` (UI/UX Pro Max design-intelligence skill) which was done and consulted.

### Phase 11.8 — Instagram feed (1 commit)

| SHA | Commit |
|-----|--------|
| `0760659` | feat(feed): Instagram-style FeedCard with author header + day grouping |

FeedItem widened (bodyPreview / authorName / attachmentCount, all optional). FeedCard became a social post: avatar with Thai initials + author + relative time, ring-tinted type chip, 18px title + body preview, score-published blue callout, due/attachment meta chips, role-aware footer CTA. Day-bucket dividers (วันนี้/เมื่อวาน/weekday/Buddhist date). Filter row = iOS segmented control.

### Phase 11.9 — Interactive 2D/3D motion (11 commits)

| SHA | Commit |
|-----|--------|
| `90f6520` | docs(adr): ADR-0029 task-modulated 2D/3D motion budget |
| `…` | feat(motion): framer-motion + 3 primitives (Tilt3D, EntryStagger, AmbientBackground) |
| `…` | feat(dashboard): ambient blobs on student + teacher heroes |
| `…` | feat(dashboard): Tilt3D + EntryStagger on all course/class grids |
| `…` | feat(auth): ambient blob bg + spring card entry |
| `…` | feat(feed): EntryStagger reveal on feed posts |

**ADR-0029** — task-modulated motion budget extending ADR-0028. 4 tiers: T1 Showcase (landing, real 3D — deferred Phase 12), T2 Interactive (dashboards/shells/lists/feed/auth — CSS tilt + blobs + stagger), T3 Responsive (content detail — stagger + spring, no tilt), T4 Calm (grade entry/attendance/audit/forms — ADR-0028 unchanged). **Data-Entry-Is-Sacred Rule**: wow lives where users arrive, never where they work.

**Motion primitives** (`components/motion/`):
- `Tilt3D` — CSS 3D pointer-parallax, max 8°, touch-disabled, reduced-motion-safe, no JS lib
- `EntryStagger` — framer-motion fade-up reveal, 40ms stagger capped at 12, useReducedMotion-aware
- `AmbientBackground` — 3 drifting radial-gradient blobs (CSS @keyframes 22-30s), server component, system-colour tones

**Applied:** student hero + teacher hero ambient blobs; Tilt3D + EntryStagger on /admin/dashboard class grid, /dashboard teacher+student course grids, /teacher/courses list; auth layout blob bg + slide-up card; feed post stagger.

**Library:** framer-motion 12.40.0 (lazy, T2/T3 islands). `three`/R3F deferred to Phase 12 landing (no WebGL on authenticated pages).

### Phase 11.8+11.9 verifications

- `pnpm typecheck` = **0 errors** · `pnpm lint` = **0 errors** (254 warnings) · `pnpm test` = **429 passed**
- No schema migration. framer-motion added to client islands only — initial bundle budget (<250KB) respected.

### Tooling installed this session

- `uipro-cli` (global npm) + `.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/` skill — consulted for motion discipline (reduced-motion High severity, parallax nausea, animate-1-2-elements-max). Python 3.12 installed (winget) to run its search CLI.

## ⚠️ START HERE — Phase 11.7 Course shell redesign ปิดครบ (2026-06-06 · branch `phase-11`)

**Branch:** `phase-11` (pushed to origin) — 36 commits on top of `phase-10`'s `84df1ee` (12 Phase 11 + 6 Phase 11.5 + 5 Phase 11D + 9 Phase 11.6 + 4 Phase 11.7)

### Phase 11.7 commit table

| SHA | Commit |
|-----|--------|
| `78be1cd` | feat(course): CourseShell as .card-hero + iOS segmented TabNav |
| `c8018d6` | feat(student): course overview KPI tiles as .card-tinted variants |
| `acc5a39` | feat(teacher): course overview KPI strip + ClassCodeCard below |

### Why Phase 11.7 exists

The product owner opened `/student/courses/[id]` after Phase 11.6 landed and pushed back: *"เหมือนคุณเปลี่ยนแค่นิดเดียวเอง... หลายหน้ายังเหมือนเดิม."* The screenshot showed a plain badge + h1 + subtitle header, an underline tab nav, and three flat white KPI cards — none of which carried the course identity or the iOS+Win11 vocabulary the earlier phases established. Phase 11.5 / 11.6 had migrated tokens and dashboards but never touched the **CourseShell**, which is the highest-traffic surface in the system (every teacher + student click into a course goes through it).

### What Phase 11.7 ships

**`components/course/course-shell.tsx`** — the plain `badge → h1 → subtitle` header is replaced with a `.card-hero` surface:

- Banner zone (120px) renders the course-slot gradient mesh from `getCourseGradientForClass(course.class.id)`. Same hash as `/admin/dashboard` ClassCard + `/dashboard` course lists + `/admin/classes/[id]` drill-down → every surface that shows the course shares the identity colour
- Eyebrow chip (`ห้องเรียน` / `รายวิชาที่สอน`) floats on the banner as a frosted `.glass-nav` pill (ADR-0028 § 5 hero info-bar glass scope)
- `BookOpen` icon avatar (white rounded-2xl + `shadow-card`) overlaps the banner edge — the iOS profile-card pattern recurring across the system
- Course name = weight-600 2xl/3xl semibold, tracking -0.03em
- TabNav sits along the bottom edge of the same card surface

The sticky context bar (back link + term name) opts in to `.glass-nav` so scrolled content blurs underneath the chrome.

**`components/course/tab-nav.tsx`** — the quiet Calm Ledger underline pill becomes an iOS-style **segmented control**:

- Whole nav sits inside a tinted track (`bg-black/[0.04] + p-1`)
- Active tab is a white rounded-xl pill with `--shadow-lift`, appearing to sit "above" the track surface
- Inactive tabs are text-on-track, no chrome
- 180ms `--spring-standard` transition on bg + shadow + colour
- Horizontal scroll on narrow viewports

**`lib/course/queries.ts`** — `getCourseOfferingForTeacher` + `getCourseOfferingForStudent` widen `class` select to include `id`. Plus `app/student/courses/[id]/assignments/page.tsx` (inline DB read) gets the same widening.

**`app/student/courses/[id]/page.tsx`** — three flat `.card` KPI tiles become `.card-tinted` variants tinted by status:

- **อัตรามาเรียน** — rate ≥ 85% = green tile, 70-84% = orange, < 70% = red. The card literally turns colour to telegraph attendance health at a glance.
- **คะแนนรวม (เผยแพร่)** — blue tinted when published items exist, neutral card when none.
- **การบ้านที่ต้องทำ** — green when 0 (with `CheckCircle2` + "ส่งครบแล้ว"), orange when > 0.

Every leading number wraps in `<AnimatedStat>` (counts up from 0 on mount, snaps under reduced-motion). Each tile gains a 14px lucide icon in the eyebrow row + a semibold 3xl figure with -0.02em tracking + a soft `opacity-60` unit suffix.

The `ตารางเรียน` card title gains a small rounded-lg blue-tinted icon chip in place of the bare lucide icon — matches the soft icon-pill pattern from the dashboard hero KPIs.

**`app/teacher/courses/[id]/page.tsx`** — the single "สมาชิก N คน" link card becomes a 3-tile KPI strip matching the student overview shape:

- **สมาชิก** — blue tinted (info), AnimatedStat for active member count
- **งานรอตรวจ** — orange tinted when > 0 (action needed), neutral `.card` when 0. The tile colour itself telegraphs whether there's something to do.
- **การบ้านในห้อง** — blue tinted (info), AnimatedStat for total assignment count

ClassCodeCard moves below the KPI strip — the QR/code surface is a teacher tool not a status indicator, so it sits below the at-a-glance status row. Adds `db.submission.count` + `db.assignment.count` to the existing `Promise.all` so the page still server-renders in one Server Component pass.

### Phase 11.7 verifications

- `pnpm typecheck` = **0 errors**
- `pnpm lint` = **0 errors** (254 pre-existing warnings)
- `pnpm test` (unit) = **429 passed**
- No schema migration. CourseShell prop widens but every caller compiles unchanged because they spread course directly from the now-widened query return.

### What's queued next

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Phase 11.7 — Course shell redesign | ✅ done | Every course tab on teacher + student now lands on .card-hero + segmented TabNav |
| Phase 12 — Landing page | ⏸ pending | Now ready — theme is final, dashboards + course shell + admin all consistent |
| Phase 13 — Course colour schema customization | ⏸ pending | `Class.colorSlot Int?` migration + admin override UI · `Student.heroBgPreset Int?` for hero bg picker |
| Phase 10 deferred follow-ups | ⏸ pending | Per-class analytics + Audit CSV Thai column · Composer multi-image · Inline grade · 301 redirects |

## Phase 11.6 Per-page polish sweep (2026-06-06 · branch `phase-11`)

**Branch:** `phase-11` (pushed to origin) — Phase 11.6 initial 9 commits on top of Phase 11D

### Phase 11.6 commit table

| SHA | Commit |
|-----|--------|
| `443171d` | feat(scoring): score-item dialogs sweep to ADR-0028 system palette |
| `85526b4` | feat(teacher): gradebook + score entry pages sweep to system palette |
| `3671cbc` | feat(teacher): attendance + assignment + submission sweep to system palette |
| `5221d79` | feat(admin): user drilldown + setup tabs + audit + classes sweep |
| `93bdddb` | feat(student): term-summary palette sweep + GPA CountUp animation |
| `6e69e7d` | feat(theme): bulk system-palette sweep — all remaining dialogs + forms + course pages |

### What Phase 11.6 ships (every surface in the system palette)

Visual debt from Phase 11.5's checklist closes out. The sweep migrates every inline Tailwind `rose-` / `amber-` / `emerald-` colour call across **45 component + page files** to the ADR-0028 system palette:

```
rose-*     -> red-*       (destructive, danger, error)
amber-*    -> orange-*    (warning, in-progress, near-deadline)
emerald-*  -> green-*     (success, published, completed)
```

**Hand-written sweeps (6 commits, 14 files):**

- `components/scoring/{publish-score-item-dialog,create-score-item-form,delete-score-item-dialog}.tsx` — destructive trigger, one-way warning, error/success blocks. Removes the `border-rose-200` stroke (ADR-0028 cards default to flat tinted), shifts validation hints.
- `components/scoring/score-grid.tsx` — published warning, error/success callouts, late + retroactive-edit inline badges.
- `app/teacher/courses/[id]/scores/{page,[scoreItemId]}.tsx` — published badge + per-row mini-badge migrate to green; section-level "เผยแพร่ครบ" chip.
- `components/attendance/grid.tsx` — STATUS_ACTIVE map (PRESENT/LATE/EXCUSED/ABSENT) migrates emerald/amber/blue/rose → green/orange/blue/red, back-edit warning to orange, error/success blocks.
- `app/teacher/courses/[id]/attendance/{page,[sessionId]}.tsx` — cancelled badge + reason text → red.
- `app/teacher/courses/[id]/assignments/page.tsx` + `[assignmentId]/page.tsx` — STATUS_LABEL map for SUBMITTED/LATE_SUBMITTED/RETURNED migrates to green/orange/red.
- `app/teacher/courses/[id]/assignments/[assignmentId]/submissions/[submissionId]/page.tsx` — current-version border + chip + ส่งสาย badge.
- `components/admin/{setup-tabs,reset-password-card}.tsx` — every validation hint, delete-button hover, success callout (reveal-once temp password) migrates. The "เก็บไว้แจ้งผู้ใช้" hint shifts amber → orange.
- `app/admin/{audit/page,audit/[id]/page,users/[id]/page,classes/[id]/page}.tsx` — tierBadgeClass helper rebinds CRITICAL/IMPORTANT to red/orange. RoleBadge collapses from saturated 3-colour map (purple/blue/amber) to the neutral `.badge` class per ADR-0028 § 2 No-Saturated-Role-Colour Rule. /admin/classes/[id] header replaces flat amber gradient with the `.card-hero` pattern matching /admin/dashboard — same course-slot gradient mesh so the drill-down inherits the colour.
- `components/scoring/term-summary-view.tsx` — GPA value picks up AnimatedStat with `decimals=2` on the screen path; print path keeps static `formatGpa()`. Status chips (จบเทอมแล้ว / ปัจจุบัน / ยังไม่จบเทอม) and progress bar migrate.
- `components/dashboard/animated-stat.tsx` — new `decimals` prop renders fixed-precision decimals via `.toFixed()` for GPA + percentage surfaces.

**Bulk sweep (1 commit, 31 files):**

One-shot Node script walked 31 remaining surfaces with a fixed mapping table (deleted post-sweep). The script produced 172 token replacements across:

- 4 assignment dialogs (create + grade + return + submit-version)
- 3 announcement dialogs (create + edit + delete)
- 3 material dialogs (create + edit + delete)
- 4 comment surfaces (composer + edit + moderate-delete + delete)
- 4 attendance helpers (timetable-editor + student-stats + create-session-form + cancel-session-dialog)
- 2 course shell dialogs (remove-member + class-code-controls)
- class-picker recent-classes star (amber-500 → orange-500)
- copy-button toast colours
- feed unified-composer
- 4 student course pages (overview / scores / assignments list + detail)
- 2 admin import (page + form)
- 1 teacher courses new form

### Phase 11.6 verifications

- `pnpm typecheck` = **0 errors**
- `pnpm lint` = **0 errors** (254 pre-existing warnings)
- `pnpm test` (unit) = **429 passed**
- No schema migration. No new test cases.

### Remaining inline matches (intentional)

`grep -rln 'rose-|amber-|emerald-'` against app/ + components/ shows only:

- `prose-sm` — Tailwind typography plugin class on material/announcement view pages (substring match on `rose-` is a false positive)
- `--color-course-rose-{50,500}` + `--color-course-amber-{50,500}` in `globals.css` — ADR-0028 § 2 course slot tokens (intentional name; rose/amber here are course identity slots, not status colours)

The system now contains zero unintended Tailwind-default rose/amber/emerald inline colour calls. Every status surface across teacher + student + admin reads through the ADR-0028 4-colour system palette.

### What's queued next

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Phase 11.6 — per-page polish sweep | ✅ done | 45 files migrated, 0 unintended Tailwind defaults remain |
| Phase 12 — Landing page | ⏸ pending | Real screenshots from theme final · photographic banner asset commission |
| Phase 13 — Course colour schema customization | ⏸ pending | `Class.colorSlot Int?` migration + admin override UI · `Student.heroBgPreset Int?` for hero bg picker |
| Phase 10 deferred follow-ups | ⏸ pending | Per-class analytics + Audit CSV Thai column · Composer multi-image upload pipeline · Inline grade input on submission view · 301 redirects |

### Compat shims still resident in `app/globals.css`

ADR-0014's Ink+Gold orphan shims (`.mesh-bg`, `.blob`, `.sheen`, `.glass`, `.tilt-card`, `.text-gradient-*`, `.perspective-*`, `.preserve-3d`, `.card-dark` aubergine fallback) remain as no-ops. Each shim retires when the last consumer page is migrated; no page in app/ currently references them (last sweep verified via grep).

## Phase 11D Dashboards on new theme (2026-06-06 · branch `phase-11`)

**Branch:** `phase-11` (pushed to origin) — Phase 11D initial 4 commits on top of Phase 11.5

### Phase 11D commit table

| SHA | Commit |
|-----|--------|
| `114fad7` | feat(dashboard): getTeacherTodaySchedule + getStudentTodaySchedule helpers |
| `1373420` | feat(teacher): /dashboard hero with 4 KPI tiles + today schedule |
| `0e141a4` | feat(admin): wire AnimatedStat to dashboard KPI values |
| `c995375` | feat(student): today's class panel above DueSoon |

### What Phase 11D ships (dashboards reach full polish)

**`lib/dashboard/queries.ts`** gains `getTeacherTodaySchedule` + `getStudentTodaySchedule` — read TimetableSlot rows for the current `dayOfWeek` + active Term, scoped to a teacher's CourseOfferings or a student's active enrollments. Returns the same `TodayClass` shape from both so UI doesn't branch on role. `classId` included for CourseColorChip marker integration. No Session materialization required — planned timetable, not the materialised reality.

**`components/dashboard/animated-stat.tsx`** — small client leaf that wraps an integer KPI with `useCountUp` + `formatCountUp`. Single component reusable across all three role dashboards. Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` (snaps to target) and SSR (renders target instantly on first paint).

**`components/dashboard/teacher-hero.tsx`** — server component matching ADR-0028 § 8 medium vibrancy for teachers:
- `.card-hero` outer with soft blue-tinted radial banner (NOT saturated `.card-accent` — that's student-only)
- "พื้นที่ทำงานของคุณ" pill chip sitting over the banner edge in the iOS profile-card avatar-overlap pattern
- Semibold 3xl greeting + body subtitle summarising today's first slot
- KPI strip uses `.panel-inset` with 4 tiles: วิชาที่สอน / นักเรียนทั้งหมด / งานรอตรวจ / คาบ-สัปดาห์
- งานรอตรวจ flips to `text-orange-700` when > 0 (system warning)
- AnimatedStat counts every value up from 0 on initial paint
- ตารางวันนี้ list with CourseColorChip marker per row

**`components/dashboard/student-today-panel.tsx`** — compact "วันนี้" panel above `DueSoonWidget`. Renders nothing when no slots today. Same row shape as TeacherHero's ScheduleRow (marker + course name + room + monospace time range). Colour identity carries through from the dashboard course grid chips.

**`/admin/dashboard`** — 4 `KpiCard` values (ครู / นักเรียน / ห้องเรียน / Critical Audit 7d) animate via AnimatedStat on hydration. SSR renders the final number for crawlers; rAF animation only runs after hydration.

### Phase 11D verifications

- `pnpm typecheck` = **0 errors**
- `pnpm lint` = **0 errors** (254 pre-existing warnings)
- `pnpm test` (unit) = **429 passed**
- No schema migration. No new test cases (KPI presentation only — business logic unchanged).

### What's queued next

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Phase 11D — Dashboards on new theme | ✅ done | Teacher hero + KPI + today schedule · Admin CountUp · Student today panel |
| Phase 11.6 — per-page polish sweep | ⏸ pending | Teacher gradebook + attendance grid + submission view + score dialogs + admin audit detail + classes drill-down + student term summary — see Visual debt below |
| Phase 12 — Landing page | ⏸ pending | Real screenshots from theme final · photographic banner asset commission |
| Phase 13 — Course colour schema customization | ⏸ pending | `Class.colorSlot Int?` migration + admin override UI · `Student.heroBgPreset Int?` for hero bg picker |

### Visual debt (Phase 11.6 sweep targets)

Surfaces that still ship inline Tailwind defaults instead of the system palette — work as-is via token auto-shift, but lack ADR-0028 polish:

- Teacher gradebook entry grid (`/teacher/courses/[id]/scores`)
- Attendance grid (`/teacher/courses/[id]/attendance`)
- Submission view (`/teacher/courses/[id]/assignments/[id]/submissions/[id]`)
- Score item create/publish dialogs
- Admin audit detail (`/admin/audit/[id]`)
- Admin user drill-down (rose tokens in reset-password card)
- Admin setup tabs (amber tokens)
- Per-class drill-down (`/admin/classes/[id]`)
- Student term summary (`/student/courses/[id]/scores`, `/student/terms`) — GPA card pre-CountUp

## Phase 11.5 System-wide chrome sweep (2026-06-06 · branch `phase-11`)

**Branch:** `phase-11` (pushed to origin) — Phase 11.5 initial 6 commits on top of Phase 11's foundation

### Phase 11.5 commit table (system-wide sweep)

| SHA | Commit |
|-----|--------|
| `bb2525e` | feat(theme): TopNav opts in to .glass-nav frosted chrome |
| `1cb2bdd` | feat(admin): AdminSidebar blue active state + iOS soft indicator |
| `953f0b1` | feat(theme): course colour chips on /dashboard course lists |
| `d955b28` | feat(teacher): course colour markers + status badge on /teacher/courses |
| `690253b` | feat(feed): align feed surfaces to ADR-0028 status colour system |
| `514ce84` | feat(student): mobile glass-nav bottom navigation |

### What Phase 11.5 ships (chrome reaches every page)

**TopNav** opts in to `.glass-nav` — every authenticated page now shows scrolled content blurring under a frosted top bar instead of a flat strip. Single-line change because the heavy lifting moved into globals.css when the utility landed in Phase 11.

**AdminSidebar** swaps the legacy black-fill active item for the iOS Settings.app pattern: `bg-blue-50 + text-blue-700` plus a 2px blue-500 vertical bar on the left edge. Hover for inactive items shifts to `bg-black/[0.03]` (lighter). All transitions rebind to the system spring tokens. Affects every admin surface (8+ pages — /dashboard, /setup, /teachers, /students, /import, /audit, /classes/[id], /users/[id], plus future admin routes).

**CourseColorChip integration** rolls out to four list contexts via role-modulated rendering:
- Teacher `/dashboard` course grid + `/teacher/courses` overview — `variant="marker"` (4px coloured left bar)
- Student `/dashboard` course grid — `variant="chip"` (full coloured pill with class name)
- `class.id` is the hash input, so every CourseOffering of the same homeroom shares a colour — keeps "วิทยาศาสตร์ ม.4 = teal" stable across all sections

`lib/course/enrollment.ts` — `listTeacherCourses` + `listStudentCourses` now select `class.id` alongside `class.name`. No schema change; just a wider select.

**Feed surfaces** align to ADR-0028 status colours:
- DueSoonWidget urgency callout becomes `.card-tinted card-tinted-orange` (replaces amber-200/amber-50 inline border)
- CourseFeedView feed-row icon decor: ANNOUNCEMENT amber → orange, MATERIAL emerald → green, SCORE_PUBLISHED purple → blue (Purple is not part of the 4-colour system per ADR-0028 Q2.a), ASSIGNMENT keeps blue
- `ส่งภายใน` due-date strip switches amber-700 → orange-700
- UnifiedComposer FormError + field error blocks swap rose → red tokens

**StudentBottomNav** (new) — fixed-bottom 4-item glass nav for STUDENT role on mobile only. Items: ฟีด / ห้องเรียน / ผลการเรียน / แจ้งเตือน. Active state shifts to `text-blue-700` + heavier icon stroke (iOS HIG pattern). Includes `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` for iOS notched devices. Mounts inside `/dashboard` page with a 20px md:hidden spacer below the last section so the trailing card clears the bar.

### Phase 11.5 verifications

- `pnpm typecheck` = **0 errors**
- `pnpm lint` = **0 errors** (254 pre-existing warnings)
- `pnpm test` (unit) = **429 passed**
- No schema migration. No Prisma changes.

### Visual debt — what still looks legacy

Per-page polish that ADR-0028 deliberately deferred to Phase 11D / 11.6:

- Teacher gradebook entry grid (`/teacher/courses/[id]/scores`) — still uses Tailwind defaults inline
- Attendance grid (`/teacher/courses/[id]/attendance`) — same
- Submission view (`/teacher/courses/[id]/assignments/[id]/submissions/[id]`) — status colours still inline rose/emerald
- Score item create / publish dialogs — form errors not yet shifted to red-* tokens
- Admin audit detail (`/admin/audit/[id]`) — tier badges still rose/amber inline
- Admin user drill-down + setup tabs — partial sweep (reset-password card has rose; setup tabs have amber)
- Per-class drill-down (`/admin/classes/[id]`) — still uses pre-ADR-0028 chrome
- Student term summary (`/student/courses/[id]/scores` + `/student/terms`) — GPA rendering still pre-CountUp

These all WORK with the new tokens (auto-shift on `.card / .btn-primary / .input / .badge`) but the inline `bg-rose-*` / `bg-amber-*` / `bg-emerald-*` / `bg-purple-*` are still Tailwind defaults rather than the system palette.

## Phase 11 Theme migration foundation (2026-06-06 · branch `phase-11`)

**Branch:** `phase-11` (pushed to origin) — Phase 11 initial 12 commits on top of `phase-10`'s `84df1ee`

### Phase 11 commit table

| SHA | Commit |
|-----|--------|
| `42fe3cf` | docs(adr): ADR-0028 Calm Ledger v2 color-friendly + material (extends 0014) |

| `fd0e5cd` | feat(student): /dashboard student hero as .card-accent blue (ADR-0028) |

### What shipped

**ADR-0028 — Calm Ledger v2 (extends ADR-0014).** Locked through a multi-round /impeccable grill that started from the product owner's pain "Project จืดมาก ไม่มีสีสัน หมองหม่นมาก" and landed at (B) Extend Calm Ledger: keep the chrome philosophy (off-white body, Anuphan single family, pill geometry, rounded-2xl cards), add three vectors on top — 4-colour iOS-style system palette, 8-slot course identity palette, and material depth via .card-hero + .panel-inset + scoped frosted glass.

**Token rewrite (`app/globals.css`).** Body bg shifts `#F5F5F5` → `#F2F2F7` (iOS systemGroupedBackground). Tailwind v4 `@theme` block gains System Blue/Green/Orange/Red (50/500/600/700), 8 course colour slots (rose/coral/amber/lime/teal/sky/indigo/violet @ 50/500), motion tokens (`--ease-spring` + 3 duration tiers 80/180/280ms), and glass tokens (desktop 20px blur / mobile 12px / body-tinted bg + opaque fallback). Aubergine retired. `prefers-reduced-motion` fallback shifts from 0.01ms instant → 100ms ease-out.

**7 new utility classes.** `.card-accent` (4 saturated), `.card-tinted` (4 subtle), `.card-hero` (banner + content split with hover translateY), `.panel-inset` (subordinate stats strip — NOT a nested card), `.glass-nav` (frosted sticky chrome with `@supports` fallback), `.sheet` (mobile bottom-sheet variant on native `<dialog>` via `@media max-width: 768px`), `.springy` (press-feedback scale 0.98 utility).

**Modified primitives.** `.btn-primary` swaps black → System Blue + inset white-15 top highlight + spring press feedback. `.btn-tinted` is new (soft blue alternative). `.input` focus shifts black 2px → blue 2px + outer blue/20 glow (reduced-motion drops glow but keeps ring). Status badges gain `.badge-success/.badge-warn/.badge-danger/.badge-info` variants; role badges stay neutral grayscale per ADR-0014 inheritance.

**Course identity system (`lib/theme/course-color.ts` + `components/course/course-color-chip.tsx`).** `getCourseSlot(classId)` hashes via djb2 → slot 0-7. `getCourseSlotGradient(slot)` returns a CSS background composed of three offset radial gradients used as the banner zone of `.card-hero`. `<CourseColorChip variant="chip|marker|dot">` renders the three role-modulated shapes ADR-0028 § 8 specifies.

**Three critical sweeps.** (1) Login + Signup + Join + ForceReset auth pages — error blocks shift Tailwind rose-* → system red-50/red-700, success states pick up green-50/green-700 where semantically meaningful. (2) `/admin/dashboard` class cards rebuild as `.card-hero` matching the product owner's iOS-profile-card reference image — course-slot gradient banner, glass year-chip, white avatar circle overlap, panel-inset stats strip. ADR-0028 § 8 Gallery Exception in action. (3) `/dashboard` student greeting becomes `.card-accent card-accent-blue` with the arrow-circle CTA in System Blue tones. Teacher and admin keep the calm text greeting (Phase 11D will deepen teacher).

**New libraries.** `lib/hooks/use-count-up.ts` — rAF-driven number animation with `prefers-reduced-motion` snap. `formatCountUp(value)` for Thai locale formatting. `components/layout/bottom-sheet.tsx` — forwardRef wrapper around `<dialog>` that bakes in the `.sheet` class for greenfield dialogs (existing dialogs opt in by adding `sheet` to className).

### Phase 11 verifications

- `pnpm typecheck` = **0 errors**
- `pnpm lint` = **0 errors** (254 pre-existing warnings, was 256 — slight reduction from auth sweep cleanup)
- `pnpm test` (unit) = **429 passed** (+10 from Phase 10C baseline: +8 course-color, +2 formatCountUp)
- `pnpm test:integration` — not re-run (theme migration is pure CSS/JSX; lib/scoring + permissions + audit untouched; existing 172 integration tests still cover the same surface)
- No schema migration. No Prisma changes.

### What's queued next

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Phase 11 — Theme migration iOS+Win11 | ✅ done | Calm Ledger v2 per ADR-0028 |
| Phase 11D — Dashboards on new theme | ⏸ pending | Teacher hero + 4 KPI cards · Student full hero + Today's class + Due Soon + Course grid · CountUp wired · 6 preset bg picker in Student Settings (localStorage) |
| Phase 12 — Landing page | ⏸ pending | Real screenshots from theme final · photographic banner asset commission |
| Phase 13 — Course colour schema customization | ⏸ pending | `Class.colorSlot Int?` migration + admin override UI |

### Deferred from Phase 10 (still non-blocking)

- Per-class analytics + Audit CSV Thai column (Phase 10B follow-up — `lib` helpers in place)
- Composer multi-image upload pipeline (Phase 10C deferred)
- Inline grade input on submission view (Phase 10C deferred)
- 301 redirects from old list landings → `/feed?type=` (Phase 10C deferred)

### Compat shims still resident in `app/globals.css`

ADR-0014's compat shims for retired Ink+Gold utilities remain as no-ops since Phase 11 ships chrome + 3 critical pages only. Each shim retires as the last consumer page is migrated under Phase 11D or later:

- `.mesh-bg`, `.blob`, `.sheen`, `.glass` (Ink+Gold non-frosted, distinct from `.glass-nav`), `.tilt-card`, `.text-gradient-gold`, `.text-gradient-ink`, `.perspective-*`, `.preserve-3d`
- `.card-dark` (aubergine) — falls back to `.card-tinted-blue` for any leftover consumer; grep confirmed no app/* page references it post-Phase-11

---

## Phase 10 ปิดครบทั้ง 3 sub-phase (2026-06-05 · branch `phase-10`)

**Branch:** `phase-10` (pushed to origin) — 18 commits on top of `main`'s `15f31a9` (Phase 9 P9-4 close-out)

### Phase 10A · Foundation (8 commits)

7 commits documented in this section's earlier revision (ADR-0024 sum-based scoring · ADR-0027 audit rendering · schema cutover · lib/scoring + lib/audit + lib/dashboard). Verifications: 413 unit + 172 integration passing post-cutover.

### Phase 10B · Admin surface (8 commits)

| SHA | Commit |
|-----|--------|
| `c9067ca` | docs(adr): ADR-0025 Course Feed tab + ADR-0026 admin user drill-down |
| `8b8d879` | feat(auth): temp-password.ts pure generator for Admin reset flow |
| `128a7e0` | feat(admin): setup CRUD lib + teacher single-add + reset-password lib |
| `e1eb6d4` | feat(admin): /admin/setup × 4 tabs (Year/Term/Class/Teacher single-add) |
| `5ce69bc` | feat(admin): /admin/users/[id] drill-down + reset-password (ADR-0026) |
| `d49e796` | feat(admin): /admin/audit verbose Thai sentence rendering (Q9 + ADR-0027) |
| `f1c8057` | feat(admin): dashboard Class Cards + /admin/classes/[id] drill-down (Q3/Q6) |

**What shipped:**
- **`/admin/setup` × 4 tabs** — AcademicYear / Term / Class / single-Teacher CRUD with delete-block policy (Q8c) + reveal-once temp-password for the teacher add path.
- **`/admin/users/[id]`** — full non-secret profile drill-down (identity / auth meta / relationships / last 50 audits) + reset-password reveal-once UI per ADR-0026 § 2. passwordHash is in DB but never on the wire. Self-reset is blocked for attribution.
- **`/admin/audit`** — list page now renders the **verbose Thai sentence** per row (ADR-0027 + Q9 lock) via the Phase 10A `renderAuditLog` helper. Actor name resolved through Teacher/Student/Admin sub-rows. Technical enum literal accessible on hover for ops.
- **`/admin/dashboard`** — Class Cards grid (Q6 lock: Card = Class, not CourseOffering). KPI row uses `lib/dashboard/queries.getAdminStats` (Phase 10A shared module); Critical-audits-last-7d gets a rose ring when count > 0.
- **`/admin/classes/[id]`** — per-class drill-down with course list + roster (links to `/admin/users/[id]` for both teachers and students). Per-class analytics (rankings + CSV export) deferred to task #8 — non-blocking.

**Admin sidebar** gains "ตั้งค่าโครงสร้าง" nav item between "ภาพรวม" and "ครู". Teacher/Student list pages link names → `/admin/users/[id]` drill-down.

### Phase 10C · Course Feed redesign (1 commit · multi-feature)

| SHA | Commit |
|-----|--------|
| `ab06cca` | feat(course): Phase 10C — Course Feed tabs + unified composer (ADR-0025) |

**What shipped:**
- **Tab nav reshape** per ADR-0025: teacher 8→6 tabs, student 7→5 tabs. การบ้าน / เอกสาร / ประกาศ list tabs dropped from nav; detail routes survive. **"ฟีด" is the new first tab (default landing)**.
- **`/(teacher|student)/courses/[id]/feed`** — chronological stream with type-chip filter row (ทั้งหมด · ประกาศ · การบ้าน · เอกสาร · คะแนนที่เผยแพร่). Server-rendered chips via `?type=` URL param (no client filter state). Insta-style FeedCard with kind-colored icon tile + Buddhist-short due dates for Assignment rows.
- **`lib/feed/getCourseFeed`** — new function that reuses the Phase 7 multi-query union scoped to one course + optional FeedKind filter. The cross-course `getUserFeed` (dashboard) is unaffected; both delegate to a shared `aggregateFeed` helper.
- **`lib/feed/resolveCourseFeedHref`** — role-aware variant of the Phase 7 navigation resolver. Teacher feed rows link to `/teacher/...`, student rows to `/student/...`.
- **`<UnifiedComposer>`** Pattern-7 dialog (teacher only) with content-type chip selector — ประกาศ / การบ้าน / เอกสาร. Each sub-form posts to its own Server Action (composeAnnouncementAction / composeAssignmentAction / composeMaterialAction); the chip choice just routes the submit. Assignment form has the isScored toggle that reveals the fullScore field (ADR-0024 — no weight input ever again).

**Deferred follow-ups (non-blocking, in next session):**
- Multi-image carousel attachment in the composer (presign + commit form-state wiring — ADR-0021 unchanged; the slot is reserved in the dialog).
- Inline grade input on per-submission view (replaces the Phase 6 grade modal — UX upgrade, not semantic change).
- 301 redirect from old `/courses/[id]/assignments` (etc.) list landings → `/feed?type=assignment`. Current behaviour: the URL still resolves to the legacy list page which is still wired to lib reads — harmless co-existence during the transition.

### Phase 10 verifications

- `pnpm typecheck` = **0 errors**
- `pnpm test` (unit) = **419 passed** (+6 temp-password cases on top of the 413 post-Phase-10A baseline)
- `pnpm lint` = 0 errors (256 pre-existing warnings)
- `pnpm test:integration` (live Neon) = **172 passed** post-deflake (Phase 10A run)
- Schema applied to Neon dev DB via `prisma db push` (Phase 10A weight drop + targetLabel add)

### Phase 10A · Foundation — original commit table

(retained below — the Phase 10A ADR-0024/0027 cutover details still authoritative)

**Branch:** `phase-10` (pushed to origin) — Phase 10A initial 8 commits on top of `main`'s `15f31a9` (Phase 9 P9-4 close-out)

| SHA | Commit |
|-----|--------|
| `d435ef8` | docs(adr): ADR-0024 sum-based scoring supersedes weight invariant |
| `0e5b060` | docs(adr): mark 0017 superseded + 0018 partially superseded by 0024 |
| `686eb68` | docs(context): rewrite Scoring § for sum-based formula |
| `33aa2e9` | refactor(scoring): cutover to sum-based scoring (29 files, –386 LoC net) |
| `d0634f7` | chore(prisma,audit): add AuditLog.targetLabel + 13 Phase 10 audit events |
| `9b27977` | feat(audit): label.ts + render.ts helpers + ADR-0027 |
| `e38d352` | feat(dashboard): lib/dashboard/queries.ts shared role KPI module |

**What changed (foundation only — no UI yet):**

- **ADR-0024** — Sum-based scoring formally supersedes ADR-0017 weight invariant. `weight` column dropped from `ScoreItem`. Course grade = `Σscore / ΣfullScore × 100`. `fullScore` alone encodes per-item influence (Quiz fullScore=10 vs Midterm fullScore=50 → Midterm carries 5× the weight automatically). ADR-0018's field-class B narrows to `{fullScore}` only; class A and C unchanged.
- **ADR-0027** — Audit log gains `AuditLog.targetLabel String?` denormalised snapshot column captured at fire time (per emitter). Verbose Thai sentence renderer in `lib/audit/render.ts` + per-event noun map in `lib/audit/label.ts`. ADR-0025 (Course Feed tab) and ADR-0026 (admin user drill-down) deferred to their respective phase entries per "natural editing path" convention.
- **13 new audit events added to `AuditEvent` union** for Phase 10B Admin CRUD surface + analytics export: `ACADEMIC_YEAR_{CREATED,UPDATED,DELETED}`, `TERM_{CREATED,UPDATED,DELETED}`, `CLASS_{CREATED,UPDATED,DELETED}`, `HOMEROOM_ASSIGNED`, `TEACHER_CREATED_SINGLE`, `PASSWORD_RESET_BY_ADMIN`, `CLASS_ANALYTICS_EXPORTED`. No fire sites yet — they land with Phase 10B.
- **`lib/dashboard/queries.ts`** — Shared KPI module: `currentTerm()`, `getTeacherStats`, `getStudentStats`, `getAdminStats`. Phase 10A ships lib only; UI consumers land in Phase 11D once the iOS+Win11 theme migration provides final visual tokens (Phase 11).

### Phase 10A grill summary (Phase 10 plan covers 10A + 10B + 10C)

Phase 10 origin = Q1-Q11 grill (~2h conversation). Top locked decisions:
1. **Admin password viewing** = NEVER — bcrypt-only. Admin drill-down + password-reset-with-temp-reveal flow lands in 10B.
2. **Weight removed** — sum-based scoring per ADR-0024 (this phase, ✅)
3. **Father reference** = `C:\Users\Rayz\Father` (external project, not in repo)
4. **Course Feed tab** = unified Feed landing for `/(teacher|student)/courses/[id]` with type-chip composer (announcement/assignment/material) + multi-image carousel. Replaces 3 separate tabs. ADR-0025 lands at 10C entry.
5. **No GIF uploads** — kept ADR-0021 blocklist intact, multi-image carousel covers Insta-style feel
6. **Admin Class Cards dashboard** — Card = Class (homeroom), not CourseOffering. Drill-down per-Class → per-CourseOffering score rankings + class-level aggregate attendance. CSV export of analytics audited (`CLASS_ANALYTICS_EXPORTED`)
7. **Audit log** — denormalised `targetLabel` snapshot + verbose Thai sentence rendering (ADR-0027, this phase ✅)
8. **`/admin/setup` × 4 tabs** for AcademicYear/Term/Class/single-Teacher CRUD (lands in 10B)
9. **Dashboards Father-style** — hero + 4 stats + today's schedule (teacher) + Due Soon + Feed + Course grid (student). NO GPAX. Lands in Phase 11D after theme migration.
10. **Revised order from Q-revised:** 10A → 10B → 10C → 11 (theme) → 11D (dashboards on new theme) → 12 (Landing Page). User decision because: Landing Page needs real screenshots; theme migration changes visual tokens before dashboard polish makes sense.

### Phase 10A verifications

- `pnpm typecheck` = **0 errors**
- `pnpm test` = **413 passed** (was 384 + 13 new audit-render + 8 new dashboard slot-minute + restructured 8 scoring-calc + restructured scoring-format)
- `pnpm lint` = 0 errors · 256 pre-existing warnings (vendor + .github/skills/* + a few unused-imports in legacy tests)
- Schema applied to Neon dev DB via `prisma db push --accept-data-loss` (3 dev `ScoreItem.weight` values dropped, pre-launch per Q11b)

### Phase 10A follow-up (task #7 — in_progress as of this commit)

Integration tests `tests/integration/permissions/{score-item-lifecycle, assignment-coupling}.test.ts` rewritten for sum-based shape — test names + bodies + audit-payload assertions now reflect ADR-0024 instead of weight-based invariant. `scoring-l1-and-gpa.test.ts`, `score-entry.test.ts`, `submission-flow.test.ts` were already semantically correct after the mechanical weight strip — comments updated where misleading.

Test count on live Neon will land at ~135 integration cases (same as Phase 9 — re-shaped, not added).

### Pre-Phase-10 baseline (everything below is still authoritative)

Phase 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9 closure tables, hot-fix history, and Pattern catalogue (Patterns 1-14) follow below — Phase 10A's rules of engagement deliberately stay aligned with them:
- Pattern 2 (authz inside `$transaction`)
- Pattern 3 (TX_OPTS on every transaction)
- Pattern 4 (DB-layer L1 projection)
- Pattern 6 (no `.bind()` on Server Actions; hidden form fields for context ids)
- Pattern 7 (native `<dialog>` deferred-close)
- Pattern 8 (`"use server"` async exports only)
- Pattern 10 (audit events past-tense)
- Pattern 14 (active ∪ ever-marked grid union)

### Phase 1-2-3-4-5-6 — ปิดครบ ✅

อ่าน 3 ไฟล์เรียงนี้ก่อนแตะอะไร:
1. **`HANDOFF.md`** (ไฟล์นี้ — START block + Patterns section)
2. **`CLAUDE.md`** — hard rules + coding conventions

**P5-6 ScoreItemTemplate** — deferred per Q5 grill lock; reserved for a future phase once teachers report demand for template-copy across CourseOfferings.

### What "shipped" means today

- **Teacher course detail** — 5 tabs (ภาพรวม · สมาชิก · เช็คชื่อ · คะแนน · ตั้งค่า):
  - Overview: ClassCodeCard + member count link
  - Members: active-only list + "นำออก" dialog (reason 5–500, audit `COURSE_MEMBER_REMOVED`)
  - **Attendance**: Session list + "+ เปิดคาบ" dialog + per-Session grid (Pattern 13 dual-layout) + back-edit reason gate (>24h) + cancel-session dialog · `SESSION_CANCELLED` / `ATTENDANCE_BACK_EDIT` audits
  - **Scores (Phase 5)**: Score Item list + Σ น้ำหนัก pill (green @ 10000bp / amber otherwise) · `+ เพิ่มรายการคะแนน` dialog · per-row Publish + Delete dialogs · per-item grid (Pattern 13 dual-layout) with bulk `ทุกคนคะแนนเต็ม` + post-publish reason gate that triggers ONLY on value changes (not note-only) · empty-cell skip semantic at the action layer
  - Settings: regenerate code, activate-toggle, set/clear expiry — each with its own audit event · **TimetableEditor card** · **`เกณฑ์เกรด` read-only card** (Q5 lock: editor deferred, runtime `gradeFor()` already accepts `gradeRulesJson` overrides so future enablement is UI-only)
- **Student course detail** — 4 tabs (ภาพรวม · เพื่อนร่วมห้อง · เช็คชื่อ · คะแนน):
  - L1 visibility enforced at the Prisma SELECT layer — no classCode, no peer studentIds, no enrolledAt on the wire
  - **Attendance L1 view**: KPI "อัตราการมาเรียน %" + 4-status count tiles + per-Session timeline showing own status only
  - **Scores L1 view (Phase 5)**: weighted total preview over published portion · per-course grade (only when fully published) · published items + own values only · Lock card surfacing unpublished item count
  - Dashboard student cards now LINK to `/student/courses/[id]`
- **Student top-level — `ผลการเรียน` (Phase 5)** at `/student/terms` (default = active term) + `/student/terms/[termId]` (history):
  - Term GPA headline · 3-state badge `EMPTY | IN_PROGRESS | COMPLETED` (one-way per ADR-0018) · progress bar (publishedItems / totalItems)
  - Transcript table: วิชา · ครู · หน่วยกิต · % · เกรด · GPA footer row
  - TermPicker dropdown (when student has > 1 historical term)
  - **Print PDF** via `window.print()` — A4 stylesheet hides chrome/forms/btns, prints transcript-style with print-only footer "พิมพ์เมื่อ … · เอกสารอ้างอิง: <studentId/termSuffix>"
- **Auto-restore on rejoin** — removed student using the same class code triggers `restoreByRejoin` inside `enrollByClassCode`, audit `COURSE_MEMBER_RESTORED_BY_REJOIN`. Permanent block = deactivate code in Settings (ADR-0013 § 2 kill switch)
- **Session lifecycle (Phase 4)** — lazy materialization via `findOrCreateSession` (race-safe), soft-cancel via `cancelSession` (audit `SESSION_CANCELLED` Critical tier with reason ≥ 5), sparse `AttendanceRecord` with `editCount` + back-edit reason gate (`ATTENDANCE_BACK_EDIT` Important tier when >24h elapsed AND a row changes/creates)
- **ScoreItem lifecycle (Phase 5)** — strict basis-point weight invariant (ADR-0017 § Decision 1, `WEIGHT_SUM_BP = 10000`, no tolerance, no auto-distribute) · publish is a one-way door (ADR-0018, no `unpublishScoreItem` function exists) · post-publish field edits dispatch by class A (cosmetic, free) / B (`fullScore` / `weight`, `reason ≥ 5` + `SCORE_EDIT_AFTER_PUBLISH` audit + Σ revalidation in tx + fullScore-shrink-vs-entries gate) / C (`source`, immutable — `field_immutable_after_publish`) · post-publish delete requires reason + `SCORE_DELETE_AFTER_PUBLISH` Critical-tier audit + explicit ScoreEntry cascade in tx

### Audit event additions

Phase 3 (CLASS_CODE + COURSE_MEMBER families, past-tense — zero migration since no fire site existed for the old verb form):
- `COURSE_MEMBER_JOINED` (replaces `STUDENT_JOINED_COURSE`)
- `COURSE_MEMBER_REMOVED` (new — was reserved as `STUDENT_REMOVED_FROM_COURSE`, never fired)
- `COURSE_MEMBER_RESTORED_BY_REJOIN` (new)
- `CLASS_CODE_REGENERATED` (renamed from `CLASS_CODE_REGENERATE`)
- `CLASS_CODE_DEACTIVATED` / `CLASS_CODE_REACTIVATED` (new)
- `CLASS_CODE_EXPIRY_SET` (new — covers both set and clear via before/after)

Phase 4 (attendance family):
- `SESSION_CANCELLED` (new · Critical tier · with reason ≥ 5)
- `ATTENDANCE_BACK_EDIT` (existing in enum, first fire site this phase · Important tier · with reason ≥ 5 when scheduledStart > 24h ago AND a row changes/creates)

Phase 5 (scoring family, past-tense per Pattern 10 — enum cleaned to drop pre-publish events that we explicitly do NOT log):
- `SCORE_ITEM_PUBLISHED` (new · Important tier · after-payload includes name/weight/fullScore/publishedAt)
- `SCORE_EDIT_AFTER_PUBLISH` (existing in enum, first fire sites this phase · Important tier · with reason ≥ 5) — fires from class-B field edits in `updateScoreItem` AND from value-changing `bulkUpsertScoreEntries` calls on a published ScoreItem (single audit row per batch)
- `SCORE_DELETE_AFTER_PUBLISH` (existing in enum, first fire site this phase · Critical tier · with reason ≥ 5)
- **Removed from enum**: `SCORE_ITEM_CREATE`, `SCORE_ITEM_DELETE`, `SCORE_ITEM_PUBLISH` (verb-form). Renamed `SCORE_ITEM_PUBLISH → SCORE_ITEM_PUBLISHED`. Zero migration — no fire site existed.

**Verbose tier (NOT logged)** — TimetableSlot CRUD (Q11C), normal in-window attendance writes, **pre-publish ScoreItem CUD** (ADR-0018 § Negative consequences — teachers freely build the gradebook in draft state), normal in-window ScoreEntry writes on draft items.

Security.md § 7 reflects all of these.

### Patterns established this phase (MUST follow in Phase 4+)

These are battle-tested through 4 hotfix cycles. Don't re-derive — use these:

#### 1. Pure `can.*` + DB-touching `assert.*` (lib/auth)
Predicates in `lib/auth/permissions.ts` are **pure sync, no I/O** — testable in `tests/unit/permissions.test.ts` style. DB lookups live in `assert.*` (`lib/auth/guards.ts`). Course-scoped asserts return `{session, course}` / `{session, enrollment}` (divergent from simple asserts which return `Session` alone) — saves callers a duplicate fetch. **Phase 4-5 mutations:** add `assert.canMarkAttendance(sessionId)`, `assert.canEditScoreItem(itemId)` etc. in the same pattern.

#### 2. Authorization INSIDE the `$transaction`
Closes TOCTOU between auth check and mutation. Pattern in `lib/course/enrollment.removeMember` + `lib/course/class-code.*`:
```ts
await db.$transaction(async (tx) => {
  const entity = await tx.entity.findUnique({ where: {id}, select: {teacherId, ...} });
  if (!entity) throw new NotFound();
  if (entity.teacherId !== actorUserId) throw new Forbidden();
  await tx.entity.update({...});
  await audit({...}, tx);  // ← include audit inside tx
}, TX_OPTS);
```

#### 3. **TX_OPTS = `{ maxWait: 10_000, timeout: 15_000 }` on EVERY $transaction**
Prisma's default `maxWait` (2s) is too short for Neon cold-start. Always pass `TX_OPTS` as 2nd arg to `db.$transaction(...)`. Const lives at top of `lib/course/enrollment.ts` and `lib/course/class-code.ts`. **Phase 4+ mutation lib files:** define your own `TX_OPTS` const + apply.

#### 4. DB-layer projection for L1 visibility
`getActiveMembersForStudent` strips `studentId`/`enrolledAt` at the Prisma `select`, not via caller `.map(strip)`. Defense in depth — data physically never leaves DB. **Pattern for Phase 5 (scoring) + 6 (assignments):** any "students see X about peers" query needs a `*ForStudent` projection that returns only L1-safe fields.

#### 5. `_tabs.ts` per role
`app/teacher/courses/[id]/_tabs.ts` + `app/student/courses/[id]/_tabs.ts` each export a `<role>CourseTabs(id)` function. Underscore prefix keeps Next.js from routing it. **Phase 4-7:** extend the existing arrays when adding tabs (Attendance, Scores, Assignments, Feed).

#### 6. Server Actions: NO `.bind()`, use hidden form field for context IDs
Under Next 16 + Auth.js v5 beta, `.bind(null, courseId)` intermittently drops the session cookie. Pattern:
```tsx
// Client
<form action={formAction}>
  <input type="hidden" name="courseId" value={courseId} />
  <input type="hidden" name="otherContextId" value={...} />
</form>

// Server action
export async function myAction(_prev, formData) {
  const session = await requireRole(["TEACHER"]);
  const courseId = String(formData.get("courseId") ?? "");
  if (!courseId) return { error: "missing_course_id" };
  ...
}
```

#### 7. Native `<dialog>` — explicit centering + defer-close
```tsx
<dialog
  className="fixed inset-0 m-auto h-fit w-[calc(100%-2rem)] max-w-md ..."
>
```
Default centering breaks when `w-full` is set. After action success:
```ts
useEffect(() => {
  if (!state.ok) return;
  setTimeout(() => {
    const d = dialogRef.current;
    if (!d) return;
    d.close();
    d.removeAttribute("open");
  }, 0);
}, [state.ok]);
```
The `setTimeout(_, 0)` + `removeAttribute('open')` belt-and-braces is needed because synchronous `close()` in the same commit cycle as Server Action result sometimes doesn't take.

#### 8. `"use server"` files — async function exports ONLY
Next 16 strictly enforces "A 'use server' file can only export async functions". No types alone (use `export type` is fine, only TYPE-only exports), no const objects, no helper functions exported. Helper functions stay internal.

#### 9. React 19 `set-state-in-effect` lint rule
Don't call `setState` inside `useEffect` based on action result. DOM side effects (`dialogRef.current?.close()`) are fine. To reset form state, rely on the row unmounting after revalidation OR use uncontrolled inputs.

#### 10. Audit event naming — past-tense, namespaced family
COURSE_MEMBER_*, CLASS_CODE_*, and (Phase 4) attendance families established. Past-tense (`SESSION_CANCELLED`, `ATTENDANCE_BACK_EDIT`) not verb form. **Phase 5:** create SCORE_* family — `SCORE_ITEM_PUBLISHED` (replaces `SCORE_ITEM_PUBLISH`), `SCORE_EDIT_AFTER_PUBLISH` (with reason ≥ 5), `SCORE_DELETE_AFTER_PUBLISH`.

#### 11. Time zones — store UTC, render via Intl with Buddhist calendar (Phase 4)
All `DateTime` columns are UTC instants (Postgres `TIMESTAMPTZ`, Prisma `Date`). Conversion to/from "Asia/Bangkok wall-clock" is centralised in `lib/attendance/format.ts`:
- `formatThaiDate(d)` / `formatSessionHeader(start, end)` — `Intl.DateTimeFormat("th-TH-u-ca-buddhist", { timeZone: "Asia/Bangkok", … })` → "วันพุธที่ 3 มิ.ย. 2569 · 13:00–14:00 น."
- `bangkokDateTimeToUtc(dateStr, timeStr)` — converts a `YYYY-MM-DD` + `HH:mm` pair entered in a Bangkok-local form back to a UTC `Date`. Bangkok is fixed +07:00 (no DST), so the math is direct: subtract 7h after building the wall-clock as if UTC.
- `dayOfWeekForDateString` / `todayInBangkok` — server-safe, no manual TZ math.

**Phase 5 implication:** Term GPA + Score Item published timestamps follow the same posture. Don't pass `new Date(localString)` into the lib — always go through the format helper.

#### 12. `useState` lazy initializer to dodge React 19 purity lint (Phase 4)
React 19's `react-hooks/purity` rule flags `Date.now()` inside `useMemo`. For values that are stable for the lifetime of the component (e.g. "is this Session past the 24h back-edit threshold?"), capture once at mount:
```tsx
const [isBackEdit] = useState(
  () => Date.now() - new Date(scheduledStartIso).getTime() > THRESHOLD_MS
);
```
The initializer runs once. **Phase 5+** any client-side time-of-render derived flag (e.g. "is this Score Item published in the future?", "is this Submission past deadline?") uses the same pattern.

#### 13. Mobile/desktop dual-layout via CSS toggle (Phase 4)
Teacher attendance grid renders BOTH a vertical card list (`md:hidden`) and a table (`hidden md:block`) from the same component, swapping by Tailwind breakpoint at CSS layer. Avoids SSR hydration mismatch from JS breakpoint detection. Bundle hit is the duplicate markup, which is small for ≤50-row grids. **Phase 5 scoring grid:** apply same posture — desktop-first table, mobile vertical card per student.

#### 14. Sparse semantics + "active ∪ ever-marked" union (Phase 4 · ADR-0016)
The grid query for a Session is NOT "active members at this moment". It's:
```sql
SELECT enrollment FROM enrollment
  WHERE courseOfferingId = $1
    AND (removedAt IS NULL OR EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM attendanceRecord WHERE ...))
```
Removed-then-marked rows persist with `opacity-60` + read-only badge. **Phase 5+** any "what rows do I show for this `<event>` of a course?" follows the same union when soft-deletion intersects with student-data writes (ScoreEntry, Submission). The bare `removedAt IS NULL` filter is wrong for historical event views.

### Test commands (post-P3-7 script split)

| Command | Scope | DB needed? | Time |
|---------|-------|------------|------|
| `pnpm test` | `tests/unit/**` (156 cases · 12 files) | no | ~5s |
| `pnpm test:integration` | `tests/integration/**` (116 cases · 11 files) | yes — uses DATABASE_URL via `.env.local` | ~290s |
| `pnpm test:all` | both | yes | ~295s |
| `pnpm exec dotenv -e .env.local -- tsx scripts/smoke-test.ts` | E2E HTTP smoke (88 checks · live dev server required) | yes | ~60s |

**Total verifications post-Phase 5:** 156 unit + 116 integration + 88 smoke = **360**.

`pnpm test` (CI script) stays unit-only so the existing GitHub Actions
job needs no env changes. Devs run `pnpm test:integration` locally
before pushing changes that touch lib/course/*. Adding a Postgres
service container (or pointing CI at a dedicated Neon branch) to the
test-unit job is a clean follow-up — not blocking.

### CI status — green ✅

All commits since `c46b7c4` have passed 3/3 jobs (Lint/Typecheck, Unit Tests, Build). Pre-commit hooks (prettier + eslint + husky stash backup) catch issues before they hit CI.

### Commit discipline rule (CLAUDE.md § Commits) — held throughout this phase

- Every diff → review + commit ตามนั้น (ไม่สะสมข้าม feature)
- 1 commit = 1 concern
- Pre-commit: `pnpm typecheck` + `pnpm lint` 0 errors
- Propose breakdown ก่อนเริ่ม commit แรกของ session ถ้า groups > 2
- HEREDOC สำหรับ multi-line message, no Co-Authored-By, no "Generated with Claude" footer

### Known deferrals (Phase 1-2-3 spec ที่ defer ไป)

ไม่มีอะไร blocking — list นี้ documented เพื่อ honesty:

| Item | Original phase | Status | Why deferred |
|------|----------------|--------|--------------|
| Playwright E2E tests | Phase 1, 2 (planned) | Defer → Phase 9 § 9b | smoke-test.ts (57 checks) + integration (22 cases) ครอบคลุม 90%; E2E expensive to maintain pre-launch |
| gitleaks pre-commit hook | Phase 0 (planned) | Defer → Phase 9 § 9b | Solo dev, low credential leak risk; Phase 9 hardening sweep |
| Testcontainers | Phase 0 (planned) | **Dropped** | Superseded by Neon-based integration tests (working great) |
| Upstash Redis rate limit | Phase 1 (planned) | Defer → Phase 9 | `RateLimitBucket` (in-DB) works fine; Phase 9 migrate |
| Cloudflare R2 | Phase 0 + 6 (planned) | As-planned → **Phase 6** | Required first time in Assignment file upload |
| Sentry / Vercel deploy | Phase 0 (planned) | As-planned → Phase 9 | Pre-launch only |
| GitHub branch protection on `main` | Phase 0 | **User-side TODO** | Can't config from code — verify in GitHub Settings before Phase 4 push if you haven't |

### What "shipped" means today (post-Phase-6)

- **Teacher course detail — 6 tabs** (ภาพรวม · สมาชิก · เช็คชื่อ · คะแนน · **การบ้าน** · ตั้งค่า):
  - **Assignments (Phase 6)**: list ordered DESC by createdAt · per-row scored-badge + published-ScoreItem badge + submission-closed badge + overdue tinted rose · "+ เพิ่มการบ้าน" Pattern-7 dialog with conditional weight (%) + fullScore inputs when `isScored=true` (per ADR-0019 § 2 no default). Detail page = Pattern-14 active ∪ ever-submitted union (removed students show opacity-60 + badge) + per-row grade dialog (with ADR-0018 reason-after-publish gate that mounts only when needed) + return dialog (comment body = audit reason per ADR-0020 § 4)
- **Student course detail — 5 tabs** (ภาพรวม · เพื่อนร่วมห้อง · เช็คชื่อ · คะแนน · **การบ้าน**):
  - **Assignments (Phase 6)** L1-projected: list joins OWN Submission row only (NOT_SUBMITTED sentinel when no row) · detail surfaces RETURNED banner when teacher returned + own ScoreEntry when linked ScoreItem published + PRIVATE comments thread + own version history (DESC by versionNumber, current version highlighted) + submit form for text + links (file upload deferred per P6-3d note)
- **R2 file pipeline ready**: presign + commit + magic-byte + EXIF-strip + sharp transcode are fully implemented and unit-tested (55 cases). Teacher upload to Assignment brief works through `assert.canUploadTo("ASSIGNMENT", id)`. Student upload to SubmissionVersion follows a small schema patch (SubmissionVersion.fileAttachmentIds + FileOwnerType.SUBMISSION) when the UI surfaces it — documented as a Phase 7 prerequisite in P6-3d commit message.

### Audit event additions (Phase 6 family · past-tense per Pattern 10)

- `SUBMISSION_RETURNED` (new · Important tier · reason = private comment body ≥ 5 chars per ADR-0020 § 4)
- `ASSIGNMENT_UPDATED` (new · Important only when `isScored: true → false` toggle with reason ≥ 5; verbose tier for normal field edits, not logged)
- `COMMENT_MODERATED` (new · Important when Teacher · **Critical when Admin × PRIVATE** per CONTEXT § Comment Moderation Q5 escalation)
- `FILE_UPLOADED` (new · Important · payload omits URL string per CLAUDE.md hard rule — only ids + mime + size)
- `FILE_REJECTED` (new · Important · categories: `magic_byte_mismatch` / `mime_not_whitelisted` / `size_exceeds` / `permission_denied`)
- `FILE_DELETED` (new · Important · owner removal or moderator delete)
- `FILE_INFECTED_BLOCKED` (Critical · enum reserved, no fire site in Phase 6 — AV deferred to Phase 9 hardening sweep)
- **Removed from enum** (replaced renamed or dropped — zero migration, no prior fire sites): `ASSIGNMENT_CREATE` / `ASSIGNMENT_EDIT` / `ASSIGNMENT_DELETE` / `ASSIGNMENT_GRADE` / `ASSIGNMENT_RETURN` / `FILE_UPLOAD`. The verbose-tier per-action events (CREATE / DELETE / GRADED pre-publish / VERSION_CREATED / COMMENT_EDITED / COMMENT_SELF_DELETED) are not in the enum because they are intentionally not logged — same posture Phase 5 used for pre-publish ScoreItem CUD.

### Test commands (post-P6-7 update)

| Command | Scope | DB needed? | Time |
|---------|-------|------------|------|
| `pnpm test` | `tests/unit/**` (299 cases · 16 files) | no | ~6 s |
| `pnpm test:integration` | `tests/integration/**` (135 cases · 13 files) | yes — uses DATABASE_URL via `.env.local` | ~330 s |
| `pnpm test:all` | both | yes | ~336 s |
| `pnpm exec dotenv -e .env.local -- tsx scripts/smoke-test.ts` | E2E HTTP smoke (~98 checks · live dev server required) | yes | ~70 s |

**Total verifications post-Phase 6:** 299 unit + 135 integration + ~98 smoke = **~532**.

### Phase 9 (P9-1..4) — CLOSED (2026-06-05 · `1a96338` → `b6da021`)

Phase 9 split into two halves by user choice (Q1 = (3) "A + E"):
**A — E2E tests + E — Polish carryover** land now; **B/C/D — security
hardening · performance · deploy infra** defer to a follow-on phase
so the feature surface stays nice and small.

**P9-1 — Notification payload enrichment (`1a96338`)**

`SubmissionGradedPayload` + `SubmissionReturnedPayload` gain
`assignmentId`. `CommentRepliedPayload` gains `entityOwnerId` (for
SUBMISSION = parent Assignment id; for the others = ownerId verbatim).
`lib/notification/navigation` consumes the new ids to deep-link
SUBMISSION_GRADED / RETURNED to assignment detail and
COMMENT_REPLIED to the commented entity. Also lights up
MATERIAL_POSTED / ANNOUNCEMENT_POSTED → student detail routes that
P7-8 shipped (was a course-root fallback). +6 unit tests
(395 → 401).

**P9-2 — PRIVATE composer on Submission (`5bfc6ec`)**

`<CommentsThread>` grows a `revalidatePath?` override so SUBMISSION
threads can point the post-action revalidate at the page they
actually sit on (the assignment id can't be reconstructed from
ownerType + ownerId alone). Student Submission detail drops the
Phase-6 read-only PRIVATE comment card and mounts the real thread
+ composer. A new teacher per-submission page at
`/teacher/courses/[id]/assignments/[aid]/submissions/[sid]` hosts
the same thread, plus a read-only version-history card. The
assignment grid gains a "ดูข้อความ →" link per row to reach it.

**P9-3 — Playwright E2E (`b6da021`)**

Suite at `tests/e2e/` with 2 critical-flow specs:
- **01 announcement → feed → reply** — teacher posts an
  Announcement; student sees it in the dashboard User Feed; clicks
  through to the detail page (P7-8 student detail); posts a
  CLASS_WIDE reply that lands in the thread.
- **02 material → bell → deep-link** — teacher posts a Material;
  student's bell popover surfaces the row; clicking deep-links to
  the student Material detail (the P9-1 navigation upgrade).

Helpers anchor on Thai text ("ออกจากระบบ") because the bell popover
also renders a submit button inside the navbar form. Config keeps
the suite serial (shared Neon dev DB) and reuses the dev server
the developer is already running.

`pnpm test:e2e` is the entry point (uses `dotenv -e .env.local`).

Drive-by: `lib/feed/navigation.ts` flipped MATERIAL / ANNOUNCEMENT
from course-root fallback → entity detail URL (same gap P9-1 fixed
in `lib/notification/navigation.ts`). 2 existing unit cases flipped
expectations; no net unit-count change.

**Phase 9 (P9-1..4) sub-task SHAs:**

| Sub-task | SHA |
|---|---|
| P9-1 enrich notification payloads + nav deep-links + 6 unit tests | `1a96338` |
| P9-2 PRIVATE composer on Submission + teacher per-submission page | `5bfc6ec` |
| P9-3 Playwright config + 2 critical-flow specs + lib/feed nav follow-up | `b6da021` |
| P9-4 close-out — HANDOFF + phase table | this commit |

**Verifications post-Phase 9 (P9-1..4):** 401 unit + 171 integration +
~133 smoke + 2 E2E = ~707 total checks.

**Deferred to a future hardening phase (was Phase 9 B/C/D + remaining
polish):**

- **B — Security hardening:** gitleaks pre-commit hook · Sentry
  error tracking · OWASP-style sanity sweep · file-upload AV (the
  `FILE_INFECTED_BLOCKED` audit event is reserved but no scanner is
  wired)
- **C — Performance hardening:** Lighthouse / axe-core audit · bundle
  size budget · Upstash Redis rate-limit migration (currently in-DB
  `RateLimitBucket`) · cross-browser Playwright projects (Firefox +
  WebKit)
- **D — Deploy infra:** Vercel project config · env var wiring · R2
  bucket / IAM · branch protection on main · observability hooks
- **E (residual):** Admin dashboard tier-count widgets (carried
  from Phase 8) · enrich Notification with `(tier, timestamp DESC)`
  schema index once row count crosses ~1M

---

### Phase 8 — CLOSED (2026-06-05 · `ff492b1` + `4a1a82f`)

Phase 8 ships the **admin-facing read surface for the audit log**
accumulated since Phase 1. 3-question mini-grill locked design
before code:

- Q1 = A: pure-helper `lib/audit/tier.ts` for tier dispatch — no
  schema migration, no DB column. `tierFor(action)` for the per-
  action default; `tierForRow({action, actorRole, beforeScope})`
  applies the CONTEXT § Comment Moderation Q5 escalation (Admin ×
  PRIVATE × COMMENT_MODERATED → CRITICAL).
- Q2 = A: shareable URL drill-down at `/admin/audit/[id]` — browser
  back works, bookmarkable for forensic. Per-event detail page
  shows tier badge + timestamp + actor + target + IP/UA + reason
  + side-by-side before/after JSON.
- Q3 = C: core (tier + filter + drill-down) + CSV export ship in
  Phase 8; dashboard summary widgets dropped to Phase 9 polish.

**Viewer upgrade (`app/admin/audit/page.tsx`):** Tier column with
Critical/Important/Verbose badge, 3 new filters (Tier dropdown ·
Actor identifier substring · Target type/id substring), Bangkok-
local datetime-range filter (from / to) converted to UTC at the
edge, "ดู →" link per row, "ดาวน์โหลด CSV" button forwarding the
filter querystring.

**Drill-down (`app/admin/audit/[id]/page.tsx`):** Read-only forensic
surface. No delete affordance (Security.md § 7 — Admin
ไม่สามารถลบ audit log ผ่าน UI).

**CSV export (`app/admin/audit/export/route.ts`):** GET handler
returns RFC-4180-compliant CSV (UTF-8 + CRLF + double-quote-escape),
capped at 50 000 rows, with `Content-Disposition: attachment` +
`X-Audit-Row-Count` / `X-Audit-Truncated` headers. Each export
writes one `ADMIN_AUDIT_EXPORTED` Important audit row capturing the
filter snapshot — audit of the audit reader.

**Verifications post-Phase 8:** 395 unit (+11) + 171 integration +
~133 smoke (+11) = ~699 total.

**Phase 8 sub-task SHAs:**

| Sub-task | SHAs |
|---|---|
| P8-1 lib/audit/tier.ts pure helper + 11 unit tests + ADMIN_AUDIT_EXPORTED event | `ff492b1` |
| P8-2 viewer upgrade + drill-down detail + CSV export route + 11 smoke checks | `4a1a82f` |
| P8-3 close-out + HANDOFF | this commit |

**Deferred to Phase 9:**
- Dashboard summary widgets — count cards "Critical last 7 days",
  "Important last 7 days" on `/admin/dashboard`
- Optional `tier` column in the AuditLog schema (Phase 9 hardening
  sweep — index on `(tier, timestamp DESC)` would speed the viewer
  WHERE clause once row count crosses ~1M)

### Phase 7 — CLOSED (2026-06-05 · final `757f4ad` + P7-10 close-out)

| P7-10 Close-out — dashboard footer · final smoke sweep · HANDOFF roll-up | ✅ | `07ad363` |

**Verifications post-P7-9:** 384 unit + 171 integration (+23) + ~124 smoke = ~679 checks

**Lib layer essentially done.** All 9 NotificationKinds have wired event sources end-to-end:

| Kind | Source mutation | Fan-out helper |
|---|---|---|
| `SCORE_ITEM_PUBLISHED` | `publishScoreItem` | broadcast |
| `SCORE_ENTRY_EDITED` | `bulkUpsertScoreEntries` (post-publish, value change) | targetedMany |
| `ASSIGNMENT_POSTED` | `createAssignment` | broadcast |
| `MATERIAL_POSTED` | `createMaterial` | broadcast |
| `ANNOUNCEMENT_POSTED` | `createAnnouncement` | broadcast |
| `SUBMISSION_GRADED` | `gradeSubmission` (markGraded=true) | targeted |
| `SUBMISSION_RETURNED` | `returnSubmission` (merges with private comment) | targeted |
| `COMMENT_REPLIED` | `createComment` (PRIVATE → targeted, CLASS_WIDE → thread) | targeted/thread |
| `CLASS_CODE_JOINED` | `enrollByClassCode` | targeted |

Suppress hooks:
- `removeMember` → suppressNotificationsForRemovedMember (in-tx)
- `restoreByRejoin` → unsuppressNotificationsOnRestore (in-tx)
- `deleteScoreItem` / `softDeleteMaterial` / `softDeleteAnnouncement` → suppressNotificationsForDeletedEntity (in-tx)

Read surface:
- `lib/notification.listNotificationsForRecipient(cursor)` — bell dropdown query
- `lib/notification.countUnreadNotifications` — badge count
- `lib/notification.markNotificationRead` — click row
- `lib/notification.markAllNotificationsRead` — "ทำเครื่องหมายว่าอ่านทั้งหมด"
- `lib/feed.getUserFeed(session, cursor?)` — dashboard User Feed
- `lib/feed.getCourseScopeForUser(session)` — single L1 boundary, reused by widget

API routes (auth-first posture):
- `POST /api/notification/[id]/read`
- `POST /api/notification/read-all`
- `POST /api/storage/presign` (P7-0b)
- `POST /api/storage/commit` (P7-0b)

**P7-5 — what shipped (2026-06-04 · `996532c`)**

Bell + shared TopNav are live across every role-facing surface. 15-question
grill locked the design tree before code (Q1 surface = shared TopNav · Q2
admin = no bell · Q3 = server-render eager · Q4 = HTML popover (not Pattern
7 dialog) · Q5 = server-resolved href, fallback to course root for
MATERIAL/ANNOUNCEMENT/SUBMISSION_*/COMMENT_REPLIED · Q6 = Server Action +
redirect · Q7 = time DESC + opacity-60 read + black dot unread · Q8 =
hybrid 7d relative/absolute · Q9 = per-kind lucide icons + Thai preview ·
Q10 = illustrated empty + top-right mark-all conditional · Q11 = cap 20
no load-more · Q12 = replace headers · Q13 = file structure middle-ground
· Q14 = no audit · Q15 = stack TopNav above CourseShell's course bar).

**New files (`a2615ed`):** `lib/notification/{navigation,preview,time-format}.ts`
pure helpers; their 42 unit tests (330 → 372).

**New files (`9d82121`):** `components/notification/{bell,bell-icon,relative-time,actions}.tsx`.
Bell is a Server Component fetching count + 20-row list via P7-4 read
surface, builds per-row href + preview server-side, renders an HTML
`popover` panel (browser-native open/close — no JS state). Per-row form
posts to `markReadAndNavigate` server action that marks read + redirects.

**New files / migrations (`996532c`):** `components/layout/top-nav.tsx`
shared Server Component (logo + bell + sign-out, `showBell` prop for
admin = false, `showRoleBadge` prop for admin layout). Replaces inline
headers on `app/admin/layout.tsx`, `app/dashboard/page.tsx`,
`app/teacher/courses/page.tsx`, `app/teacher/courses/new/page.tsx`,
`components/scoring/student-terms-shell.tsx`, and stacks above
CourseShell's existing course-context bar (Q15). 13 CourseShell call
sites updated to pass `session` (uses `guard.session` where applicable).

**Drive-by:** P7-4 had a typecheck-only drift in
`tests/integration/permissions/feed-aggregator.test.ts` `mkSession`
helper (missing `mustResetPwd`); fixed forward in commit `a2615ed`.

**Known follow-ups for P7-6+:**
- Enrich `SubmissionGradedPayload` / `SubmissionReturnedPayload` /
  `CommentRepliedPayload` with `assignmentId` / `entityOwnerId` at fan-out
  time so the bell can deep-link to the assignment detail page (today
  these fall back to the course's assignments list).
- After P7-7 / P7-8 land Material + Announcement UI, the navigation
  resolver's `MATERIAL_POSTED` / `ANNOUNCEMENT_POSTED` cases can switch
  from course-root fallback to the entity detail URL.
- Phase 5/6 teacher login + Phase 7 storage student login in
  `scripts/smoke-test.ts` still cascade-fail on rate-limit lockout from
  earlier sections. The new bell section preempts this with a
  `db.rateLimitBucket.deleteMany({where:{id:{startsWith:"login:"}}})`
  at its top; the same pattern would unbreak the other sections.

**P7-6 — what shipped (2026-06-05 · `ca23943`)**

Student dashboard now surfaces two state-derived sections above the
existing "ห้องเรียนของฉัน" grid (3-question mini-grill before code:
Q1 = A cap 20 no load-more · Q2 = A vertical stack Due Soon top · Q3 =
B student-only feed).

- **Due Soon Widget** — amber-tinted card listing Assignments due
  within 24 h whose own Submission status is NOT_SUBMITTED or DRAFT,
  sorted dueAt ASC, max 5. Hides itself when empty (an empty "ใกล้ส่ง"
  card next to a populated feed is more confusing than no card).
- **User Feed** — illustrated empty state or up to 20 rows merged
  across Assignment / Material / Announcement / ScoreItem(published)
  via the P7-4 aggregator. Reuses the bell's `NotificationIcon` +
  `RelativeTime` so both surfaces share one icon map + one Pattern-12
  time helper. Per-row href + preview resolved server-side via
  `lib/feed/{navigation,preview}`.

Teacher dashboard intentionally has neither (creator role; bell
already covers CLASS_CODE_JOINED + COMMENT_REPLIED). Admin dashboard
unchanged (no NotificationKind targets ADMIN).

**New files (`4ab67af`):** `lib/feed/{navigation,preview}.ts` pure
helpers + `lib/assignment/due-soon.ts` DB query. 12 new unit tests
(372 → 384). Due-Soon DB query covered by smoke + P7-9 integration.

**New files / changes (`ca23943`):**
`components/feed/{due-soon-widget,user-feed}.tsx` Server Components
+ `app/dashboard/page.tsx` integration + 5 smoke checks.

**Known follow-ups for P7-7+:**
- `nextCursor` from `getUserFeed` is unused — future `/feed` full-page
  route can pick it up if 20 isn't enough.
- After P7-7 / P7-8 land Material + Announcement UI, the feed's
  navigation resolver's `MATERIAL` / `ANNOUNCEMENT` cases switch from
  course-root fallback to entity detail URL.
- The "อยู่ระหว่างพัฒนา" footer card on dashboard still says "Phase
  ปัจจุบัน: 5" — cosmetic; will update wholesale at P7-10 close-out.

**P7-7 — what shipped (2026-06-05 · `0eb99a5`)**

Teacher course detail gains 2 new tabs ("เอกสาร" + "ประกาศ") between
"การบ้าน" and "ตั้งค่า" — 8 tabs total. 3-question mini-grill locked
design before code:
- Q1 = A: separate tabs per content-type (canonical per CONTEXT)
- Q2 = A: list page + click-through to detail (matches Assignment shape)
- Q3 = B: comments thread DEFERRED to P7-8 so it ships alongside the
  student view + integration test in one cohesive landing

**Material UI** (`/teacher/courses/[id]/materials/...`)
- List page · Pattern-7 create dialog (title + body + linkUrls)
- Detail page · edit/delete affordances · markdown-ish body render
- `MATERIAL_DELETED` Important audit on soft-delete (lib cascade-
  suppresses `MATERIAL_POSTED` notifications)
- title REQUIRED, body OPTIONAL

**Announcement UI** (`/teacher/courses/[id]/announcements/...`)
- Mirrors Material shape with title flip: title OPTIONAL, body
  REQUIRED. List page falls back to body excerpt as headline when
  title is null; detail page renders "ประกาศไม่มีหัวข้อ" placeholder.
- `ANNOUNCEMENT_DELETED` Important audit on soft-delete

**Smoke (+7 checks):** materials list 200 + heading + create btn ·
announcements list 200 + create btn · 8-tab nav contains เอกสาร +
ประกาศ · L1 boundary (student → /teacher/.../materials → 302/307).

**Known follow-ups for P7-8:**
- Class-wide comments thread on Material/Announcement detail pages
  (teacher composer + student view + L1 thread fan-out via
  `COMMENT_REPLIED`)
- Student view of Material/Announcement at `/student/courses/[id]/
  materials` + `/student/courses/[id]/announcements` (after which the
  bell + feed `MATERIAL_POSTED` / `ANNOUNCEMENT_POSTED` navigation can
  switch from course-root fallback to entity detail URL)
- "อยู่ระหว่างพัฒนา" footer card on dashboard still says "Phase
  ปัจจุบัน: 5" — cosmetic; wholesale update at P7-10 close-out

**P7-8 — what shipped (2026-06-05 · `e2eb851`)**

Student side of Material + Announcement now exists, and the shared
`<CommentsThread />` component lands on all six teacher/student ×
Assignment/Material/Announcement detail pages. 3-question mini-grill
locked design before code:
- Q1 = A: single reusable Server Component driven by `ownerType` prop
- Q2 = A: CLASS_WIDE thread on all 3 content types (Assignment included,
  not just M+A — single cohesive landing)
- Q3 = A: full edit/delete affordances (author 5-min edit · author
  self-delete · moderator delete with reason)

**Student tabs.** `_tabs.ts` gains เอกสาร + ประกาศ in the same position
the teacher uses; tab nav stays consistent across roles.

**Student Material + Announcement** (`/student/courses/[id]/...`)
- Read-only mirrors of teacher pages; L1 via
  `assert.isActiveCourseMember`. Soft-deleted entities 404.
- Detail pages each host `<CommentsThread />` (the same thread teacher
  sees on the corresponding teacher detail).

**Shared `<CommentsThread />` component family** (af91dde):
- `components/comment/comments-thread.tsx` Server Component fetches the
  thread inline + resolves moderator-ness; renders per-row affordances
  (author edit pencil · author self-delete · moderator delete dialog)
- Client islands: `composer.tsx` (with autoreset on success),
  `edit-comment-dialog.tsx` (Pattern 7), `delete-comment-button.tsx`
  inline, `moderate-delete-dialog.tsx` (reason ≥ 5)
- Server Actions cover all 4 lib paths (create / edit / selfDelete /
  moderateDelete); each accepts a `revalidate` hidden field
  reconstructed by the thread component from
  `(rolePrefix, courseId, ownerType, ownerId)`
- Soft-deleted comments render an italic "ข้อความนี้ถูกลบ" placeholder
  so chronology stays intact

**Six detail pages now host the thread:**
- Teacher Material + Announcement (P7-7 placeholder replaced)
- Teacher + Student Assignment detail (CLASS_WIDE thread appended
  below the existing submission grid / version history)
- Student Material + Announcement detail (newly created in P7-8)

**Smoke (+9 checks):** student materials list 200 + heading + tab ·
student announcements list 200 + tab · material detail thread heading
+ composer fields present · teacher material detail thread replaces
the P7-7 placeholder (conditional on existing demo Material).

**Known follow-ups for P7-9:**
- PRIVATE composer on Submission detail (teacher reply + student
  reply on returned submissions) — Phase 6 ships read-only PRIVATE
  comments; the full composer ships with P7-9 integration sweep
- Notification fan-out broader integration tests (multi-recipient
  COMMENT_REPLIED, dedup, suppress-on-delete cascades)
- "อยู่ระหว่างพัฒนา" footer card on dashboard still says "Phase
  ปัจจุบัน: 5" — wholesale update at P7-10 close-out

**Phase 7 — final roll-up (2026-06-05)**

Phase 7 closes with the Bell + dashboard Feed + Due Soon Widget +
teacher and student Material/Announcement UIs + shared CommentsThread
on all 6 detail pages + 23 new integration tests covering the fan-out
+ suppress + moderation seams. **Two ADRs landed during the phase:**

- **ADR-0022** — Notification storage model + in-tx fan-out +
  partial-unique dedup + suppress on entity-soft-delete + snapshot
  payload posture.
- **ADR-0023** — User Feed = multi-query union at the application
  layer + course-scope resolver as the single L1 boundary + Course
  Feed surface deferred to Phase 8.

**Every P7 SHA in chronological order:**

| Sub-task | SHAs |
|---|---|
| Grill + ADRs + CONTEXT updates | `43df25f` · `fa11175` · `7eb65e7` |
| P7-0a..d Phase-6 carry-over (file upload UI) | `00de7ae` · `f419f38` · `099a116` · `4fc81b4` |
| P7-1 schema (Notification + Material + Announcement) | `9b4912c` |
| P7-2 lib/notification + 7 mutation-site fan-out wirings | `acfccbd` |
| P7-3 lib/material + lib/announcement | `73a7684` |
| P7-4 notification read routes + lib/feed | `b64a786` |
| P7-5 Bell UI navbar + shared TopNav + migrate 6 surfaces | `a2615ed` · `9d82121` · `996532c` · `6018b4f` |
| P7-6 Dashboard User Feed + Due Soon Widget | `4ab67af` · `ca23943` · `70ae78a` |
| P7-7 Teacher Material + Announcement UI | `0eb99a5` · `7809c05` |
| P7-8 Student M+A views + shared CommentsThread on 6 detail pages | `af91dde` · `e2eb851` · `2000222` |
| P7-9 Integration tests — fan-out + suppress + comment moderation | `ffd7b89` · `757f4ad` |
| P7-10 Close-out — footer + sweep + HANDOFF | this commit |

**Verifications post-Phase 7:** 384 unit + 171 integration (+23) +
~124 smoke (+30 since post-P7-4 baseline) = ~679 total.

**Pre-existing smoke flakes** (NOT regressions — same on `main` before
P7-5): Phase 5/6 teacher login + Phase 7 storage student login hit
the rate-limit cascade from `testRateLimitLockout`. The bell + feed +
material/announcement sections defensively `db.rateLimitBucket.
deleteMany({where:{id:{startsWith:"login:"}}})` at section start to
sidestep; the same prefix-clear would unbreak the other sections in
a future cleanup commit.

**Deferred items carried into Phase 8 / 9:**
- PRIVATE composer on Submission detail (teacher reply + student
  reply on returned submissions). Phase 6 still has read-only PRIVATE
  comment display; the composer ships alongside Phase 8 admin audit
  tools or as a Phase 9 polish item.
- Enrich `SubmissionGradedPayload` / `SubmissionReturnedPayload` /
  `CommentRepliedPayload` with `assignmentId` / `entityOwnerId` so
  the bell + feed can deep-link to assignment detail instead of the
  list fallback.
- After Material/Announcement get their student-side detail routes
  in P7-8 (already done), the feed + notification navigation
  resolvers can switch from course-root fallback to entity detail
  URL — small follow-up.

---

**P7-9 — what shipped (2026-06-05 · `ffd7b89`)**

Three new integration test files lock the Phase-7 lib seams against a
real Neon DB; integration tests 148 → 171 (+23).

- **`notification-comment-fan-out.test.ts`** (+15 cases) — CLASS_WIDE
  thread rule (prior commenters ∪ entity author − self) on ASSIGNMENT
  + MATERIAL · PRIVATE on SUBMISSION = "other party" only · scope ↔
  ownerType invariant rejects PRIVATE×ASSIGNMENT and CLASS_WIDE×
  SUBMISSION · 5-min self-edit window (backdate `createdAt` 6 min
  → Conflict) · non-author edit rejected · self-delete works past
  the window and is Verbose · teacher moderate-delete writes
  COMMENT_MODERATED Important with `actorRole=TEACHER` + reason ·
  foreign teacher rejected · reason < 5 chars rejected · ANNOUNCEMENT
  thread smoke-check (drain broadcast row first, then assert
  COMMENT_REPLIED targets the author).

- **`notification-material-announcement.test.ts`** (+5 cases) —
  MATERIAL_POSTED / ANNOUNCEMENT_POSTED broadcasts cover active
  enrollments only (removed students excluded · author excluded ·
  partial unique index honored — re-inserting same `(recipient,kind,
  source)` is a no-op) · softDeleteMaterial / softDeleteAnnouncement
  cascade-suppress the matching notification rows (rows preserved,
  `suppressedAt` set) + write *_DELETED Important audit with reason.

- **`notification-enrollment-suppress.test.ts`** (+3 cases) — `removeMember`
  marks every Notification of (removed student × this course) as
  suppressed in the same tx · other students' rows in the same
  course untouched · re-joining via the same class code calls
  `restoreByRejoin` → un-suppresses (`suppressedAt = null`) those
  rows so bell history comes back alive.

**Drive-by:** `_fixtures.ts` cleanup already drained Notification by
`courseOfferingId` (added in P7-2), so no fixture change needed.

**Known follow-ups for P7-10 close-out:**
- "อยู่ระหว่างพัฒนา" footer card on dashboard still says "Phase
  ปัจจุบัน: 5" — cosmetic; update at P7-10.
- PRIVATE composer on Submission detail (teacher reply + student
  reply on returned submissions) — deferred from P7-8, may land
  in Phase 8 or as a P7-10 stretch.
- Enrich SubmissionGraded/Returned/CommentReplied snapshot payloads
  with `assignmentId` / `entityOwnerId` so bell + feed can deep-link
  instead of falling back to course root.

**Next session resume point — Phase 8:** Admin Audit Tools. The
audit log already accumulates Important + Critical events across all
phases (see `lib/audit/log.ts` + Security.md § 7). Phase 8 adds the
admin-facing read surface (filterable audit viewer · per-event drill-
down · CSV export · moderator dashboards). No new lib mutations
expected; mostly UI + read queries + permission checks.

CONTEXT § Admin already locks the moderation matrix and the
"Admin × PRIVATE comment = Critical-tier audit" escalation; Phase 8
will surface those tiers cleanly in the audit viewer.

Phase 6 carryover (now historical):



Schema to add:
- `Notification` (recipientId, kind enum, payloadJson, readAt?, createdAt)
- `Material` + `Announcement` (Phase 7a — teacher-posted content; reserved slots in FileOwnerType + CommentOwnerType enums are ready)

Phase 7 prerequisites carried over from Phase 6 (documented in P6-3d commit message and Task.md § Deferred):
- Add `SubmissionVersion.fileAttachmentIds Json @default("[]")` column
- Add `FileOwnerType.SUBMISSION` enum value (so files can attach to a Submission parent scope rather than a specific Version that doesn't yet exist at upload time)
- Remove the `files_not_yet_supported` guard from `lib/assignment.submitVersion`
- Wire `lib/storage.presignUpload` + `lib/storage.commitUpload` into a new `/api/storage/presign` + `/api/storage/commit` route pair
- Update student `submit-version-form.tsx` to accept files via a presign + PUT + commit handshake before submitVersion

Phase 7 recommended sub-task breakdown:
- P7-1 schema (Notification + Material + Announcement) + the Phase-6-deferred SubmissionVersion.fileAttachmentIds column + FileOwnerType.SUBMISSION
- P7-2 `lib/notification/*` PURE + DB-touching (event dispatch + delivery in-app)
- P7-3 `lib/material/*` + `lib/announcement/*` (mirror lib/assignment shape)
- P7-4 `/api/storage/presign` + `/api/storage/commit` route handlers + integration with lib/auth.canUploadTo for ASSIGNMENT + SUBMISSION dispatch
- P7-5 `lib/feed/aggregator.ts` (CONTEXT § Feed Activity Types — query union over Assignment / Material / Announcement / Score Published / Comments)
- P7-6 Notification bell UI (navbar component + badge count + recent list)
- P7-7 Material + Announcement UI (teacher post + student read)
- P7-8 Student file upload UI (drag-and-drop + progress + presign/commit handshake; replaces the "files_not_yet_supported" branch in submitVersion)
- P7-9 Integration tests (notification fan-out + feed aggregator L1 + file upload happy path)
- P7-10 Smoke checks + docs close-out

Patterns to inherit verbatim (Patterns 1-14 unchanged from Phase 5; Phase 6 reaffirmed each):
- Pattern 1: pure `can.*` + DB-touching `assert.*` returning `{session, row}` divergent shape
- Pattern 2: authz inside `$transaction` for every mutation
- Pattern 3: `TX_OPTS` on every transaction
- Pattern 4: DB-layer projection for L1 visibility (Phase 7 student feed query)
- Pattern 5: extend `_tabs.ts` per role (insert "ฟีด" if a per-course feed tab lands; otherwise notifications live in navbar)
- Pattern 6: hidden form fields, no `.bind()`
- Pattern 7: native `<dialog>` with explicit centering + deferred close (Phase 7 Material / Announcement create dialogs)
- Pattern 8: `"use server"` async exports only
- Pattern 9: avoid `setState`-in-effect
- Pattern 10: past-tense audit family — `NOTIFICATION_DELIVERED` (Verbose, not logged), `MATERIAL_CREATED` / `ANNOUNCEMENT_CREATED` (Verbose), `FEED_VIEWED` (Verbose if logged at all)
- Pattern 11: store UTC, render Buddhist + Asia/Bangkok via Intl
- Pattern 12: `useState` lazy initializer for "is this notification read?" / "is feed item older than 24h?" client-side flags
- Pattern 13: dual-layout (mobile cards + desktop table) for feed list — Phase 7 may relax to single-layout if feed is mobile-first
- Pattern 14: active ∪ ever-engaged enrollment union (e.g. ever-commented-on-this-feed-item) for any historical feed view

Critical files that Phase 7 will add:
- `lib/notification/*` — Verbose tier; CLAUDE.md gotcha — do not log signed URL or session token in payloadJson
- `lib/feed/aggregator.ts` — Phase 4 § Q11C posture: query union not denormalised; L1 boundary at the Prisma SELECT layer
- `lib/material/*` + `lib/announcement/*` — mirror lib/assignment shape but no scored coupling

**Phase 6 — Assignment + Submission + Comments + R2 file upload** (Task.md § Phase 6)

Schema to add:
- `Assignment` (per CourseOffering — title, description, dueAt?, allow_text/file/link, attachments, is_scored, score_item_id?, submission_closed)
- `Submission` (Enrollment × Assignment — unique)
- `SubmissionVersion` (version_number, text_content?, attachments[], links[], submitted_at, is_late, is_current)
- `SubmissionStatus` enum: NOT_SUBMITTED · DRAFT · SUBMITTED · LATE_SUBMITTED · RETURNED · GRADED
- `FileAttachment` (polymorphic — `owner_type` enum ASSIGNMENT/MATERIAL/ANNOUNCEMENT/SUBMISSION/COMMENT, `owner_id`, r2_key, mime, size)
- `Comment` (polymorphic scope — CLASS_WIDE on Assignment/Material/Announcement, PRIVATE on Submission)

ScoreItem ↔ Assignment coupling (CLAUDE.md hard rule):
- If `Assignment.is_scored = true` → atomically create a `ScoreItem` with `source = ASSIGNMENT_LINKED` and link FK
- `source = ASSIGNMENT_LINKED` is the class-C immutable case per ADR-0018 — to "delete the link", delete the ScoreItem (Critical audit) which cascades the unlink
- Deleting an Assignment that owns a published ScoreItem → block (Phase 6 entry must add `assert.canDeleteAssignmentNotPublishedScoreItem` or similar)

Library to add (mirror `lib/scoring/*` layout):
- `lib/assignment/*` — constants, validation, assignment.ts (create/update/delete + ScoreItem coupling), submission.ts (submit/return/grade), comment.ts
- `lib/storage/*` — R2 client, signed-URL gen post permission-check, presigned PUT for client→R2 direct upload, MIME magic-byte verify, EXIF strip

Permissions:
- `can.mutateAssignment(session, course)` + `assert.canMutateAssignment(assignmentId)` → `{session, assignment: {courseOfferingId, scoreItemId?, …}}`
- `can.submitTo(session, assignment, enrollment)` + `assert.canSubmitTo(submissionId)` for resubmit flows
- `can.viewSubmission(session, submission)` — student sees own; teacher sees all for owned course; admin moderation TBD

UI to add:
- Teacher: **การบ้าน** tab on course shell (between คะแนน + ตั้งค่า) — list + create dialog + per-assignment grid (submissions × status) + grade flow (writes to linked ScoreItem)
- Student: **การบ้าน** tab — list of assignments + submit form (text + file upload + link) + version history + status badges
- Comment composer (class-wide vs private) on Assignment/Submission detail pages

Patterns to inherit verbatim (Patterns 1-14 above):
- Pattern 1: `assert.canMutateAssignment(id)` returning `{session, assignment}` divergent shape
- Pattern 2: authz inside `$transaction` for every mutation; ScoreItem-coupling atomic with Assignment in the same tx
- Pattern 3: `TX_OPTS` on every transaction
- Pattern 4: DB-layer projection for L1 — students see ONLY their own Submission, never peer rows
- Pattern 5: extend teacher `_tabs.ts` (insert "การบ้าน" between "คะแนน" and "ตั้งค่า")
- Pattern 6: hidden form fields for context IDs; no `.bind()` on Server Actions
- Pattern 7: native `<dialog>` with explicit centering + deferred close (Pattern 7 from Phase 4 is the canonical form)
- Pattern 8: `"use server"` async exports only
- Pattern 9: avoid `setState`-in-effect (uncontrolled inputs or row remount via revalidate)
- Pattern 10: past-tense audit family — `ASSIGNMENT_CREATED`, `ASSIGNMENT_GRADED`, `SUBMISSION_RETURNED`, `COMMENT_MODERATED`, `FILE_UPLOAD`, `FILE_INFECTED_BLOCKED`
- Pattern 11: store UTC, render Buddhist + Asia/Bangkok via Intl (dueAt formatter)
- Pattern 12: `useState` lazy initializer for "is past deadline?" / "is current version?" flags
- Pattern 13: dual-layout grid (mobile cards + desktop table) for the submission grid
- Pattern 14: active ∪ ever-submitted enrollment union for the submission grid

**Recommended P6 sub-task breakdown** (mirrors P5 structure — 9 sub-tasks):
- P6-1 schema migration (Assignment · Submission · SubmissionVersion · SubmissionStatus enum · FileAttachment polymorphic · Comment polymorphic) + ADRs for the coupling decisions surfaced in grill
- P6-2 `lib/assignment/*` — constants, validation, assignment.ts (CRUD + ScoreItem coupling + Phase 5 invariants), submission.ts (submit/resubmit/return/grade), comment.ts
- P6-3 `lib/storage/*` — R2 client setup, signed URL helpers, presigned PUT, MIME magic-byte verification, EXIF strip
- P6-4 `can.mutateAssignment` + `assert.*` + permissions test cases (Pattern 1, mirror Phase 5 P5-3)
- P6-5 teacher Assignment tab + create dialog + submission grid + grade flow + comment composer
- P6-6 student Assignment tab + submit form (text + file via presigned PUT) + version history view + comment composer (private)
- P6-7 integration tests (Assignment-ScoreItem coupling · Submission grading flow · L1 projection · R2 mock or test-bucket)
- P6-8 smoke checks (~10 new): teacher Assignment tab · student submit flow · L1 boundary · file upload
- P6-9 docs close-out (HANDOFF + Task.md + ADR files)

**Grill before code** — Phase 6 has non-obvious branches that should be locked first via `/grill-with-docs`:

1. **Assignment ↔ ScoreItem atomicity** — `is_scored=true` creates a linked ScoreItem in the same tx; what if create succeeds and link fails? Use Pattern 2 transaction with cascade rollback. What weight does the auto-created ScoreItem get? Teacher must set it before publish — block publish until weight is set?
2. **Resubmission semantics** — `RETURNED` → student resubmits → new `SubmissionVersion` row with `is_current=true`; old row stays for audit. What if teacher already graded before returning? Score Entry stays at old value or resets to null?
3. **Late submission scoring** — `LATE_SUBMITTED` after deadline — does the linked Score Entry still accept the grade? Default behavior + opt-out toggle?
4. **File upload security** — `magic-byte verification on server vs client-side validation only`; SVG with embedded script — block entirely or sanitize? Max file size + chunk threshold?
5. **Comment moderation lifecycle** — teacher can `COMMENT_MODERATED` (delete + audit) any class-wide comment; can admin moderate teacher comments? Per Comment.scope (CLASS_WIDE vs PRIVATE)?
6. **R2 signed URL TTL** — 5 minutes per CLAUDE.md hard rules; verify against R2 ergonomics for large downloads. Re-issue on each page render or cache for 5min?

Recommend grilling Q1 + Q2 + Q4 first (highest blast radius). Q3 + Q5 + Q6 can be locked inline during P6-2 / P6-3 implementation.

## 🔐 Security Posture (Phase 1-2 baseline)

- ✅ Password: bcrypt cost 12, min 8 (student) / 12 (teacher/admin), common-password reject
- ✅ Session: httpOnly cookie, JWT, 4h sliding / 12h absolute
- ✅ Rate limit: 5 login fails → 30-min lockout (in-DB)
- ✅ CAPTCHA: Cloudflare Turnstile on signup (test keys ใน dev)
- ✅ PDPA: Privacy Policy + consent tracking + soft delete + anonymize
- ✅ CSP: secure headers + nosniff + DENY frame
- ✅ Audit: IP + UA capture for all events (7 active event types)
- ✅ Authorization: requireAuth/requireRole/can/assert pattern
- ✅ CSRF: NextAuth handles

**Deferred:**
- CAPTCHA after 3 failed logins (Phase 9)
- File upload security (Phase 6 — R2 + MIME magic byte)
- OWASP ZAP scan (Phase 9 pre-launch)

---

## 🧪 Test Coverage

**Unit tests:** 77 passing across 8 files
- `password.test.ts` (10) — bcrypt + common pwd + per-role rules
- `permissions.test.ts` (12) — pure `can.*` predicates
- `validation.test.ts` (12) — Zod schemas
- `errors.test.ts` (9) — HttpError + errorResponse
- `class-code.test.ts` (15) — generator + validator + normalizer
- `category.test.ts` (8) — grade-level → category
- `csv-import.test.ts` (10) — parse + dedupe + DB mock
- `smoke.test.ts` (1) — smoke

**Smoke tests:** 44 passing (scripts/smoke-test.ts — HTTP against live dev)
- Public pages, protected redirects, login per role, signup flow, rate limit, force reset, join flow, audit log

**E2E (Playwright):** configured but no tests yet (Phase 9)

---

## ⚠️ Known Tech Debt

| Item | Severity | Note |
|------|----------|------|
| `middleware.ts` → `proxy.ts` | Low | Next 16 deprecation warning; works fine |
| Phase 2 used `db push` not migrations | Low (dev only) | Production needs proper migrations Phase 9 |
| Prisma client EPERM on Windows | Low | Kill node procs before `db:generate`; retry works |
| `force-reset` requires Prisma consent env var | Low | Use `scripts/reset-courses.ts` pattern instead |
| No E2E Playwright tests yet | Medium | Smoke covers main flows; Playwright Phase 9 |
| CAPTCHA only on signup, not login fails | Low | Rate limit handles worst case; add Phase 9 |
| Subject removed (ADR-0012) — no cross-class report | Documented | Use `subjectCode` field if needed |
| ADRs 0001-0010 not yet in `docs/adr/` | Low | Architecture.md documents them; write files when time |

---

## 🪧 Important Gotchas (Windows / Prisma 6 / Next 16)

1. **Prisma client EPERM on regen** — When dev server is running, `pnpm db:generate` fails to rename DLL. Solution:
   ```powershell
   Get-Process node | Stop-Process -Force
   pnpm db:generate
   ```

2. **`prisma db push --force-reset` blocked** — Prisma 6 added safety check requiring `PRISMA_USER_CONSENT_FOR_DANGEROUS_AI_ACTION` env var. Workaround: use `scripts/reset-courses.ts` to clear data first, then plain `pnpm db:push`.

3. **CSRF for HTTP login testing** — NextAuth v5 returns MULTIPLE `authjs.csrf-token` Set-Cookie headers; must dedupe by name (last-write-wins) when building Cookie header. See `scripts/smoke-test.ts` → `cookiesFromSetCookie()`.

4. **dotenv-cli prefix needed for CLI** — Next.js auto-loads `.env.local` at runtime, but Prisma CLI / tsx scripts need `pnpm exec dotenv -e .env.local --` prefix. Already wrapped in `db:migrate`, `db:seed`, `db:studio`, `db:push`, `db:generate`.

5. **Tailwind v4 limitations** — Can't use `@apply` with custom component class chains. Use multi-selector for shared base styles (see `.btn` group in `globals.css`).

6. **Force reset password flow** — After password change, JWT still has `mustResetPwd=true` → would loop. Mitigation: `signOut()` after change, user logs in fresh.

7. **Workspace model (ADR-0012)** — No `Subject` table. CourseOffering owns `name`, `subjectCode?`, `gradeLevel`, `creditHours` directly. Don't add back without re-discussing trade-offs.

## 🎯 What's Next — Phase 3 Suggested Plan

**Phase 3 — Course Tabs + Members (~2-3 วัน)**

ตอนนี้ teacher course detail page (`/teacher/courses/[id]`) มีแค่ QR + members list flat
Phase 3 จะแบ่งเป็น tab structure ที่ extensible:

```
┌─── Course: คณิตศาสตร์ ม.4/2 ครูสมชาย ─────┐
│ [Overview] [Members] [Attendance] [Scores] │  ← Tabs
│ [Assignments] [Feed] [Settings]            │
└────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Scope:**
- [ ] Tab navigation component (reusable for both teacher and student views)
- [ ] Student-facing course page (`/student/courses/[id]`) with L1 visibility
- [ ] Members tab — show roster, teacher can "remove from course"
- [ ] Permission tests: student เห็น roster (no scores), ครูเห็นทุกอย่าง
- [ ] Smoke test: course detail accessible to enrolled student, blocked for others

**DoD:** ครู+นักเรียนเปิดหน้า course เดียวกัน, tab navigate ได้, Members tab ทำงาน

## 💬 How to Resume in a New Session

Paste this into the new session as your first message:

> ผมทำงานต่อจาก project Studennnn ที่ `D:\Studennnn`
> อ่าน `HANDOFF.md` + `CLAUDE.md` + `CONTEXT.md` ก่อนเริ่ม
> ตอนนี้ Phase 0-5 เสร็จแล้ว (156 unit + 116 integration + 88 smoke = 360 verifications passing)
> อยากทำต่อ: [ระบุ Phase หรือ feature ที่อยากทำ]

หรือถ้าจะ verify state ก่อน:

```bash
cd D:\Studennnn
pnpm typecheck && pnpm test && pnpm lint
# ทั้ง 3 อันต้องผ่านหมด

# Optional: smoke test (need pnpm dev in another terminal)
pnpm dev  # terminal 1
pnpm exec dotenv -e .env.local -- tsx scripts/smoke-test.ts  # terminal 2
```

ถ้าทุกอันผ่าน = state ตรงกับ HANDOFF.md → ต่อได้เลย
